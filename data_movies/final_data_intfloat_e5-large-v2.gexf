          <attvalue for="14" value="I went to see an early screening of Kids in America also (probably the same one as &quot;melinalives&quot;). I agree with most of what she had to say. It was really enjoyable. It's pretty funny (especially one scene with same sex kissing where I couldn't hear a couple of lines because people around me were laughing so hard). It's definitely a comedy, but it also tackles some serious issues, which for me was the reason I enjoyed it. Yes, there are a couple of times you can see the cracks show because it's not a big budget movie, but the lower budget doesn't stand in it's way (and for me, it was refreshing to see a teen movie that was smart). There is an homage to old 80s movies like &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; that's really cool. I think melinalives said it right when she commented that &quot;it's heart is in the right place&quot;. The performances are really good (I don't know who the lead boy is, but he's charming). If I were to find one fault with the film, the first ten minutes or so are a little bumpy but then it finds it's groove and I really got into it. And the last kiss was awesome... I'll be looking for it in the Guiness Book of World Records." />

          <attvalue for="14" value="This is made just before the slashers came out and it is a perfect example towards the slashers. Don't get me wrong, it's more an whodunit than a slasher but the first points to make it a slasher are visible. There are a few first person shots involved and we have a hero. They even try to mislead you by showing the killer's clothes a view times. On the point of gore or even blood well, there isn't any. It's somewhere between the Italian Giallo's and the, here we go again, slashers. But the acting is sublime and that's the reason why you keep watching. Up to this review it's only available on rental VHS in the US. And it doesn't go that cheap on the internet. Still for myself being a horror geek I enjoyed it. Even that it's low on the red stuff, but admit it, Texas Chainsaw and Halloween didn't had any blood too. If you are collection horror than this surely must be added in your collection." />

If I were a Catholic prayer-warrior I would use this movie to prove how gays are just shallow, selfish, sodomites with a lost direction in life. Everything about the movie seemed so empty. The character's feelings were empty, the interactions were empty. After about 30 minutes this movie just proved to be a step-and-repeat about loneliness and disappointment.Does anyone make any lasting friendships on these boats? They portrayed everyone as just heartless and cold, only smiling when they find a body to hug close to them for the night.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If this is the standard for gay cruises, count me out! I was very interested in gay cruises, but it appears from this movie I wouldn't make many lasting memories...as my memory of this movie is quickly fading.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the plus side, this movie makes me very thankful for my own gay life. I do believe I'm having way more fun than those poor souls." />

The film did a good job of bringing out the pathos - but&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;that's hardly a surprise.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The problem is, having done that, it didn't go any further in showing us the real woman behind the mask.  The film projects her as nothing but a helpless victim of Hollywood, when her early life clearly indicated a strong and wily character.  She must have put up a few fights - both internally and out there - and _this_ is the fascinating stuff.  Remember that she was financially independent and emotionally not alone.  Although in exile, she was always surrounded by family and, quite often, other Brazilian expatriate friends (among them one of the fathers of Bossa Nova, Vinicius --).  She had choices.  She didn't have to end that way and yet she did -- chose to marry an American brute and chose to leave Brazil again, right out of convalescence. This is the true mystery, and this film brings us no closer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the other direction, the film also failed to place Carmen in context of the development of Brazilian music.  Was she a true artist, or merely a star - co-opting music of the poor for the consumption of a more respectable audience?  And what is her true legacy as Brazil's &quot;cultural ambassador&quot;? Brazil may have rejected her, but it has never forgotten or ignored her (the funeral scene proved that).  Yet once again we&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;had no idea what Carmen means to an average Brazilian today.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Watching this film, I kept getting reminded of Edith Piaf. Like her, Carmen's life has enough paradoxes for two or three movies.  Regrettably, we are given less than one." />

Surprisingly, this is an engaging and frank study both of necrophilia and of a daughter's inability to let go of the past.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Helped along by a very professional sounding theme tune (sung by Kit Fuller), and a lively score echoing films of much more mainstream cinema, this is a shocking film that will make you think for a long time afterwards. Unfortunately, the good acting and imaginative story is let down by some chronically bad editing - particularly when we are suddenly introduced to the character of Alex - but this aside, you should find much more to enjoy about this movie than you will find to dislike about it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&quot;Love Me Deadly&quot; is to necrophilia what &quot;Max Mon Amour&quot; is to bestiality: one of the last taboos to be tackled in an grown-up fashion, but which can be appreciated by an audience without needing to visit a seedy sex-shop; where story comes first, and titillation is far down the line." />

          <attvalue for="14" value="I recently took a course offered by Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck @ Coursera called &quot;Discrete Optimization.&quot; The course was about solving the NP Complete problems like 'Travelling Salesman', 'Graph Coloring', 'Vehicle Routing', 'Warehouse Locations' and so on. The course was very fascinating and at most challenging. The movie is based on the premises that NP problems, or Non- deterministic Polynomial time problems are not solvable in reasonable time. Even moderately sized such problems might take trillions of years with modern computing power. So, brute-force search is out of the question. For this reason, modern cryptography are based on this assumption. When mathematicians in the movie break this assumption and prove that P = NP, i.e. such problems can actually be solved in polynomial time, there are many implications. There is a moral dilemma that it might be used unethically and also such discoveries shouldn't be locked out and classified. As my professor put it, solving(optimizing) NP problems is the most important challenge that no one has heard about. I am really grateful to this movie for addressing this issue. But other than that, there isn't much for me in it. I was expecting a little more math and knowledge about their non-deterministic processor. But the movie is catered more towards the layman, which is perfectly understandable. Instead of just trivial and heuristic solutions, the movie could have mentioned few complete algorithms just to get some credibility amongst mathematics community. For those of you interested, there is a million dollar Millennium Prize offered by Clay Mathematics Institute for proving if P = NP or P != NP ." />

While wandering the city in quest of an &quot;oral history&quot; from thousands of New Yorkers, Joe Gould meets Joe Mitchell, a writer with the New Yorker magazine. Mitchell is drawn to this strange man who strides through Greenwich Village demanding donations to his &quot;Joe Gould Fund&quot;. While we have to wait until the very end of the movie to find out Joe Gould's Secret, it's worth the wait. Director and Star, Stanley Tucci(Joe Mitchell),has evoked pre-WW2 New York as we would want it to be. His actors are first rate and fill out their characters to perfection. As the movie progresses, we become aware of the sadness and anguish that leads to the final understanding, and the clues we didn't see along the way." />

The USA centric storyline will require a little reading up on the background of the Parent Trigger Law passed in California, which allows parents to enforce overhauls in public school administration, and basically have a say in how things are run. This story is inspired by that, written by Brin Hill and director Daniel Barnz, to become a true underdog struggle.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maggie Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis headline the movie, playing the two interest groups that are affected broadly by change that's impending for the Adams Elementary school, where the former plays a single mom Jamie Fitzpatrick whose daughter Malia (Emily Alyn Lind) is enrolled in the school but being dyslexic, learns almost nothing but still got passed through the levels because frankly, nobody cares. Davis plays one of the many teachers in the school, but as Nona Alberts, she probably is the only teacher who cares about the proper education of her students, but is getting little support and attention. Add to that, she also has a son Cody (Dante Brown) who's a little bit slow to learn. Put two and two together, and joining forces, they would take on the administration, unions, and fellow teachers to try and convince everyone there's a better place they can elevate everyone's position to.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The film may seem to have an axe to grind with educational bureaucracy, since many characters on the other side are portrayed as emotionless, wanting to keep the status quo because rocking the boat doesn't serve their purpose (probably expanding their scope of work). The usual fat and lazy labels are easily applied to every bureaucrat, even making them take on the usual hiding behind the cloak of anonymity, or throwing arguments out the window because of technicalities, and the list goes on. Tasked to taking a stand publicly and individually, is probably in the fantasy fiction arena, but undoubtedly proving to be quite delicious an experience when things had to come to an explosive, though expected, conclusion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And for those who are anti-establishment, you'd probably attest to the myriad of games and dirty tricks those in power will play, in order to squash ideas and ideals that are not to their advantage. Things like character assassination, coercion, threats made on livelihoods and jobs, and enticement with benefits to the leaders to give up the good fight and abandon the rest fighting for the same ideals. And if one is up against positions of power, then expect one's history to be scrutinized, and blotches made a mountain of. It will reveal character then, if one can stomach the good fight for something one believes in, or throw in the towel to back away, disappointing many in the process, especially those who had responded and heeded the call to assist.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Being a film, one will expect the usual Checkov's gun being cocked early and unleashed when required, providing meat into a subplot to show how deep the establishment's reach can get, especially when one is under threat. And the film is naturally never without a romantic angle, provided by another teacher at Adams Elementary (played by Oscar Isaac) who finds the time to romance the very busy Jamie Fitzpatrick, having to juggle a number of jobs, odd hours, attention paid to her daughter as well as to fight the good fight against social injustice. At times though, the pace and narrative needed tightening, as elements and scenes got introduced for the sake of adding some further depth to a character, without real necessity to do so, such as Nona's deeply buried history concerning her kid.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If looked from a bigger picture angle, Won't Back Down applies beyond the US school system context, and is often reflective of experiences of those fighting for causes they believe in, going up against a behemoth called the system, organization, or establishment that has resources and clout. It's a pure underdog story that could be enjoyed, even though it's about the dirty politics that get played out behind the scenes." />

          <attvalue for="14" value="When an alien crash-lands in Area 51, a former soldier and his girlfriend try to help the being recover a device stolen from a rival alien species that will annihilate Earth before it can launch the initial codes for it to happen.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There wasn't a whole lot here that really wowed me over, as it ends up feeling more like a sci-fi film than a true horror with the aliens almost humanoid and not beasts, the focus on the recovery rather than the graphic kills, and an important error within as the ones we did get weren't very violent anyway, and the large sections of time devoted to the unraveling of the mystery surrounding the device instead of the aliens going after people, so as a horror film this one here is sorely lacking and really not worthwhile. Some of the action scenes are pretty nice and get some decent moments in, including the arrival and wiping out of a security troop on the base in a fun shoot-out, but this is totally undone by the rather insipid idea that comes in at the very end where the loyalties might be questioned by both sides, yet nothing is done with it and it's incredibly disappointing and confusing. Not a whole lot here to like at all.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rated Unrated/R: Adult Language and Violence." />
