Although there is lot of disaster movies around but not quite often you such and engaging movie which keeps your interest from start to finish. Story is simple but the way director execute it man just awesome. All the lead character was good in movie but Kristen steal the show completely. such a powerful performance by him. Story revolves around a small Norwegian town, which got hit by tsunami and aftermath of it. Gfx was also good although a bit more destruction would add more plus to the movie bottom line is if you are fan of disasters movies or not it should be on your watch list.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">

      <node id="27393" label="Some friends took me to see this film in Helsinki. I really had no idea what to expect. The evening started, as evenings at the cinema do, with a series of trailers. There came what seemed to be a trailer for a French film featuring an ageing chanteuse (shades of a Gallic Madonna perhaps) performing in front of a young, hysterical audience. I thought that there was a film I would not go and seeÂ&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Â and then it turned out it wasn't a trailer, but the start of the evening's main entertainment. The first five minutes set a scene, and a plot line appeared to be established. Not a particularly enthralling plot, perhaps, but something which might carry us along. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;How wrong we were. The plot got stuck in a Paris hotel suite, and the characterisation wasn't even skin deep. The chanteuse Â Lauren, or Sylvia Â was a diva with problems. But not interesting problems, or dramatic problems; just time-consuming ones. She had some sort of artistic block. She sent a star-struck fan who had implausibly joined her entourage, Lucie, not to buy drugs, but to buy tampons. She was mobbed by fans, a strange and unconvincing mixture, who mostly looked like thirty-something resting actors told to wear something red and plastic. She had family problems of some sort. It was immensely boring. For all I know it perked up in its last forty minutes. But by then we were already in a nearby restaurant wondering why this film should have been made, let alone marketed, or rated by the critics. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There was one good line, when the diva's agent or boyfriend or whatever said that &quot;she likes to appear wild, but underneath she's as dead as her stuffed deer&quot; - a major feature of the hotel suite, which did indeed give a livelier performance than most of the cast. Let that be the epitaph for this exceptionally disappointing movie.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">

      <node id="40344" label="The Taiwanese movie &quot;Ming tian ji de ai shang wo&quot; was shown in the U.S. with the title &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? (2013). The film was written and directed by Arvin Chen.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Richie Ren stars as Weichung, a 30-something optician. Weichung has been married for nine years to Fen, played by the lovely Mavis Fan. They have an adorable six-year-old son. However, Weichung lived the gay lifestyle before he was married, and a chance encounter with a handsome airline steward draws him back into the gay community.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;(There's a secondary plot about Weichung's sister, Mandy, who may or may not be willing to marry her fiancÃ©e. It's not much.)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The movie is billed as a romantic comedy, based mostly on the efforts of a group of gay guys who orbit around the protagonists. However, if you look at it more closely, the film is really a sad depiction of a man whose attempts to deny his gay orientation have apparently failed. This leaves him, his wife, and his child in an extremely difficult situation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We saw this film at the Little Theatre as part of Image Out--The Rochester LGBT Film Festival.

      <node id="6035" label="William Wyler's atmospheric drama has two teachers (Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) be accused of lesbianism by a guileful schoolgirl, and then have that rumour ruin their job, their lives and their friendship.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Somewhat of a taboo for the 60s, Wyler bravely tackles the subject with honesty and integrity, and his cast work well to bring the tense atmosphere to us. As the engaged, straight, Miss Wright, Audrey Hepburn suffers commendably, fighting always for the truth Â as she sees it, and as a result, losing her fiancÃ©e. Shirley MacLaine is the more ambiguous character of the two. It is not on whether the allegations were true (it is clear from the off that they are just slander of the worst kind from a bored, vindictive little girl) that the mystery of the film lies, but in whether her character does secretly love Hepburns', as more than a friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The children are less apt in their roles. None of them have names worth remembering, but the main one who spreads the rumours does it with such exaggerated facial expressions that it is difficult at times of most intense drama not to laugh, and the other girl, who aids her in the spreading of lies, is also laughable in her &quot;fear.&quot; However, if the intention was to make us dislike the children as much as possible, then they have succeeded.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But the message is clear Â lies of such a powerful decree Â even if they are spawned off what is guessed to be the truth, will damage others. It's a hefty topic, and one that lacks slightly, due to the censorship of the time, no doubt, but the behaviour and actions of the characters still ring true today Â the hypocrisy of the kind aunt, the spreading of cruel lies just for fun, the boyfriend's abandonment, and how, at the end of the day, it is always the innocent that suffer, yet some, like Hepburn's character, are brave enough to walk out in the public, with their head held high in the air, because they know they were innocent.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">

      <node id="35861" label="Having been a journalist and a documentary maker before turning to fiction, it is hardly surprising to find that Alix Delaporte has a talent for capturing reality. In &quot;AngÃ¨le et Tony&quot;, the time is now and it shows: AngÃ¨le, Tony, their family and friends are indeed people that you could meet down the street, at the baker's or at your local cafÃ©. Likewise, the place, a small fishing harbor in Normandy, is anything but artificial. Shot entirely on location in Port-en-Bessin (a small town by the sea which was already the setting of Marcel CarnÃ©'s &quot;La Marie du Port&quot;in 1949 and of Zanuck's &quot;The Longest Day&quot; in 1962), the film gives you the feeling you have always lived there, all that lacks being the spray of the sea and the smell of fish! Socially speaking, &quot;AngÃ¨le et Tony&quot; is grounded in reality as well. The hardships of being among the last fishermen in France and the struggle to survive as such are aspects that are examined seriously, albeit briefly, through descriptions, conversations and tense confrontation with the police. Last but not least, the relationships between the characters ring true: AngÃ¨le, Tony, Tony's mother, face and confront each other using ordinary everyday words, in close connection with their immediate environment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the other hand, Alix Delaporte does not mistake realism for naturalism, which is a good point. Sure, AngÃ¨le has a troubled past but the writer-director does not dwell on it. Agreed, a fisherman's life is no life of roses, but Alix Delaporte shows them taking action not moaning about their lot. Granted, the relationships between AngÃ¨le and Tony are difficult but this is not the point. The real point is to show how these strangers, who have apparently nothing in common, will open to each other and try to exist as a couple, becoming better human beings in the process. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Such a positive dynamic makes &quot;AngÃ¨le et Tony&quot;, a potentially depressing drama, a pleasant movie, both instructive and entertaining.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The leading couple is a sure-handed choice and contributes to the success of Alix Delaporte's first fictional effort. Clotilde Hesme constantly finds the right note, managing to combine stubborn aggressiveness and touching frailty. And Gregory Gadebois turns in an interesting performance as a life-like fisherman, withdrawn and brooding, but hiding romantic feelings behind this facade. His restrained acting style is so natural that you would never think he is a member of the ComÃ©die-FranÃ§aise.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All in all a good film, but which could have been even better had the director avoided a few lengthy passages, in particular when it comes to AngÃ¨le riding her bike. Why spend so much film time on scenes that do not bring much to the whole thing (Okay AngÃ¨le zigzags, a metaphor of her wayward ways, but she does it too often and too long : five seconds are enough to get the point!) while there are more interesting aspects which would benefit from a more in-depth approach? However this is only a minor defect and it should not deter you from spending an hour and a half in the company of AngÃ¨le and Tony.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">

      <node id="44133" label="Filmed mostly in 2012. Initial inspiration was sexual exploitation of women, then there was the rape of a young girl, Oksana Makar, by three men who later tried to cover their crime by burning her alive. She later needed amputation of an arm and both feet; subsequently dying. Two of the men initially, through a corrupt political system, were freed, but later found guilty. At the risk of their own lives they are bringing consciousness of female rights to be free from abuse as property as mostly supported from patriarchal and religious culture. Started and active in Eastern Europe, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and now in several other countries. Small numbers of active participants in each country, but determined. Arrested, beaten, abused, placed in inhuman isolation, threatened by police in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia (and all three places with secret Russian police participating). Consistent with what is happening in Ukraine recently.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">

      <node id="44658" label="This movie is both educational and entertaining. It shows some remarkable footage from North Korea and in some ways is a lot like The Interview Â except this is all for real!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Dennis Rodman comes off as both an inspirational figure and yet one who has many personal inner demons that he is struggling with.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There is a lot of crazy heavy stuff that happens in the movie which is beautifully made light of by the very cheery and eloquent Irish narrator, without whom the film could have been much more dark and maybe a bit of a mess.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The basketball matches Rodman manages to arrange and the coverage of them really hits you emotionally with regard to what he actually achieved. It was a historical event that will be remembered for a long time by all involved, and I'm so happy that the footage was captured, beautifully and allowed to be shown in this movie.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This movie leaves me thinking that engaging with the North Korean people and leadership through this kind of activity is the only way anything is ever going to change. Although for the common people the kind of change which the west is looking for, is maybe not what is good or best for them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Apart from some of the regime's human rights and warmongering issues, it would be nice if the country were left in some kind of peaceful yet anti-globalist state.Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5">
