Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 2009 American animated adventure-comedy film directed by Wes Anderson from a screenplay by Anderson and Noah Baumbach and based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. Featuring stop-motion animation, it stars George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. In the film, a spree of thefts led by Mr. Fox (Clooney) results in his family, and later his community, being hunted down by three farmers.
Development on the project began in 2004 as a collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick under Revolution Studios; by 2007, Revolution and Selick left for other projects. Work on Fantastic Mr. Fox was moved to 20th Century Fox, where production began in 2007 on Stage C of 3 Mills Studios in London. In addition to an original score by Alexandre Desplat, the soundtrack includes several songs from other artists.
Fantastic Mr. Fox premiered as the opening film of the 53rd edition of the London Film Festival on October 14, 2009, and was released in the United States on November 13, to critical acclaim, with praise for its humor, stop-motion animation and Anderson's direction. However, it underperformed at the box office, grossing $46.2 million against a $40 million budget. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score.
