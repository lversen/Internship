The Sea Hawk is a 1940 American adventure film from Warner Bros. that stars Errol Flynn as an English privateer who defends his nation's interests on the eve of the launch of the Spanish Armada. The film was the tenth collaboration between Flynn and director Michael Curtiz. Its screenplay was written by Howard Koch and Seton I. Miller. The rousing musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is recognized as a high point in his career.
The film was both an adventure film and a period piece about Elizabethan England's struggles with Spain, but it was also meant as a pro-British propaganda film to build morale during World War II and to influence the American public into having a more pro-British outlook.
