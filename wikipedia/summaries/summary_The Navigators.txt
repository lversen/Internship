The Navigators is a 2001 British film directed by Ken Loach with screenplay by Rob Dawber.
It tells the story of the reactions of five Sheffield rail workers to the privatisation of the railway maintenance organisation for which they all work, and the consequences for them. The film was inspired by the failure of the Connex South Central and the Connex South Eastern franchises: Connex was ultimately stripped of both franchises before the franchise period ended due to poor service and financial mismanagement.
Rob Dawber received the 2001 BAFTA award (posthumously) for "New Writer" for the film.
