Rad (international title: Hell Track) is a 1986 American sports film directed by Hal Needham from a screenplay by Sam Bernard and Geoffrey Edwards (son of Pink Panther creator Blake Edwards). The film stars Bill Allen, Lori Loughlin, Talia Shire, Jack Weston and Ray Walston, along with 1984 Olympic gymnastics champion Bart Conner.
The film was a box office bomb, grossing $2 million against a budget of $3 million, and received mixed reviews from critics.  However, it later garnered status as a cult film and an archetype of the feel-good underdog drama.
