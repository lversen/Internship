Ray is a 2004 American biographical musical drama film focusing on 30 years in the life of soul musician Ray Charles. The independently produced film was co-produced and directed by Taylor Hackford; it was written by James L. White from a story by Hackford and White. It stars Jamie Foxx in the title role, along with Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, Harry Lennix, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Richard Schiff, and Regina King in supporting roles. Along with Hackford, the film was also produced by Stuart Benjamin, Howard Baldwin, and Karen Baldwin.
It was released on October 29, 2004, by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Foxx's performance. It was also a commercial success, grossing $124.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million.
Ray received many accolades and nominations and was nominated in six categories at the 77th Academy Awards, including for Best Picture. It won two Academy Awards: Best Actor for Foxx and Best Sound Mixing. Foxx also won Best Actor at the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics' Choice becoming the second actor to win all five major lead actor awards for the same performance, and the only one to win the Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy category, rather than in Drama.
Charles had planned to attend a screening of the completed film but died of liver disease in June 2004, four months prior to the premiere.
