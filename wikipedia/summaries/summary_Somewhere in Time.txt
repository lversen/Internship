Somewhere in Time is a 1980 American romantic fantasy drama film from Universal Pictures, directed by Jeannot Szwarc, and starring Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer. It is a film adaptation of the novel Bid Time Return (1975) by Richard Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay. 
Reeve plays Richard Collier, a playwright who becomes obsessed with a photograph of a young woman at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan. Through self-hypnosis, he manifests himself back in time to the year 1912 to find love with actress Elise McKenna (portrayed by Seymour). He comes into conflict with Elise's manager, William Fawcett Robinson (portrayed by Plummer), who fears that romance will derail her career, and attempts to stop him.
The film is known for its musical score composed by John Barry, featuring pianist Roger Williams. The 18th variation of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini is also used several times.
Seymour disclosed at the 2022 TCM Classic Film Festival that she and Christopher Reeve fell in love while working on the film. However, they broke up after Reeve found out his ex-girlfriend was expecting his child. The two remained close friends until Reeve died.
The film garnered a serious cult following and in 1990 super fan Bill Shepard, founded a fan club called INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere In Time Enthusiasts.
