Jo is a French comedy film, originally released in 1971. It is known in English-language territories either as Joe: The Busy Body or The Gazebo. It was directed by Jean Girault and stars Louis de Funès as playwright Antoine Brisebard, Claude Gensac as an actress and his wife Sylvie Brisebard as well Bernard Blier as inspector Ducros.
The script is based on a play by Alec Coppel, published in 1958, The Gazebo. Jo is its second adaptation, the first one being the 1959 film The Gazebo, starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds.
In the film, a comic playwright is being blackmailed by someone who knows about his wife's familial relationship to a notorious criminal. The playwright decides to kill the blackmailer and to hide his remains in the foundations of his new pavilion. The supposed blackmailer is killed accidentally, and the body is hidden as planned. But the writer soon finds out that his blackmailer was murdered elsewhere, and that the man which he met was an imposter. His hiding place turns out to be inadequate due to faulty construction, and he must find a way to transport the corpse.
