Deathtrap is a 1982 American black comedy suspense film based on the 1978 play of the same name by Ira Levin. It was directed by Sidney Lumet from a screenplay by Levin and Jay Presson Allen, and stars Michael Caine, Dyan Cannon and Christopher Reeve. Critics gave the film mostly favorable reviews, while noting its plot similarities to Caine's 1972 film Sleuth.
The film narrates the tale of a famous playwright, who has not had any hits in recent years. After his student entrusts him with the manuscript of a promising play, the writer tells his wife that if the student hasn’t told anyone else about his play, he could kill the student and claim the manuscript as his own.
