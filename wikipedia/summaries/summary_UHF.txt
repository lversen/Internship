UHF (released internationally as The Vidiot from UHF) is a 1989 American comedy film starring "Weird Al" Yankovic, David Bowe, Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson, Kevin McCarthy, Michael Richards, Stanley Brock, Gedde Watanabe, Billy Barty, Anthony Geary, Emo Philips and Trinidad Silva. The film is dedicated to Silva, who died shortly before filming wrapped. The film was directed by Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager, who also co-wrote the screenplay with him. The film was originally released by Orion Pictures and became owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Yankovic and Levey struggled to find a production company to finance the film, but eventually secured Orion's support after agreeing to a $5 million budget. Principal photography took place around Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Yankovic stars as George Newman, a shiftless dreamer who stumbles into managing a low-budget television station and is surprised by success with his eclectic programming choices, spearheaded by the antics of a janitor turned children's television host, Stanley Spadowski (Richards). The competitive upstart provokes a major network station. The title refers to the ultra high frequency (UHF) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations were often placed in the United States. Yankovic and Levey wrote the film following Yankovic's second album, "Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D, and set parodies within George's vivid imagination.
UHF was a financial disappointment, as it was overshadowed by several concurrent major Hollywood blockbusters. The film also received mixed critical reviews, which left Yankovic in a slump until the surprise success of his next album, Off the Deep End in 1992. UHF became a cult film on home video and cable TV. The VHS version was rare and out of print for many years, with high prices online. In 2002, the DVD was released, and Shout! Factory released a special 25th-anniversary edition on November 11, 2014, on DVD and Blu-ray.
