The World's End is a 2013 science fiction comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. It is the third film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, after Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). Starring Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike and Pierce Brosnan, the film focuses on five friends who return to their hometown for a pub crawl and uncover an alien invasion.
In 1995, Wright wrote a screenplay titled Crawl about teenagers on a pub crawl. Deciding it was better suited as a comedic exploration of young adulthood and aging, he reworked the screenplay with Pegg in the early 2010s. The film was produced by Relativity Media, Big Talk Productions and Working Title Films. Principal photography began on 28 September 2012 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including Elstree Studios, Letchworth Garden City, and Welwyn Garden City. The stunts were coordinated by members of Jackie Chan Stunt Team, and The World's End is considered a social science fiction film.
The World's End premiered at Leicester Square in London on 10 July 2013, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom by Universal Pictures on 19 July. Its release in the United States by Focus Features followed on 23 August. The film received positive reviews, with praise for the screenplay, performances of the cast, humour and direction. It won Best British Film at the 19th Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best Comedy at the 19th Critics' Choice Awards. The World's End grossed $46.1 million worldwide on a budget of $20 million.
