Porter had been told for many years that he was not employable, but he was determined to succeed and focused his efforts into working as a salesman for Watkins. Despite the awkwardness and pain of his condition, he would walk eight to ten miles a day to meet his customers. Porter supported himself, and continued to work as a salesman until age 69. 
Door to Door was nominated for twelve Emmy Awards and won six, including Outstanding Made for Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (William H. Macy). It also won a Peabody Award.
