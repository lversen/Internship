After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Troy [J.J.] [12:49]. If I were an actor, I would look beyond the roles and find the characters very funny to the point where he is not a good or a bad character. I would make sure that when you are going into these situations, you know, you should make your characters as goofy, silly and good-looking as possible. And of course, if you want to make a movie where you are not the one who is laughing, you should not make a movie that is going to be as goofy, silly and good-looking as possible. I would make sure to say so just as the rest of the cast or crew would say or do, even though I am doing the opposite. It is not my intent to make a movie with everyone thinking, "Uh, we get this cast member to be crazy for this movie."

DC: I think what he described last week was that his story was "The Other Side" -- really, he was giving you a sense of how serious he felt about the problem we are facing in the world. It happened that my first year of college there, which was when I was cast in "Lone Survivor," he told the team, "You know, I was the only guy left out, and I wanted you to get my best shot....You have to act in these situations, right?" -- so that all of this was going on behind his back, and I thought, "Well well, my life is different, so I might as well let it all out as much as we can -- and I don't wanna end up this way." He wanted to change everyone's lives at the same time.

That's a very important thing. At a time when the film is making some significant noise, and at a time where there is no mainstream movie about sex, I feel like it will be critical that I change the way I talk about sex for this kind of movie.
