After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Departed

It's the most memorable single movie to ever make it's way to theaters. The director doesn't shy away from making an ambitious and provocative, dramatic and beautiful movie, but he really seems to take his time, and it's hard to believe that he could just watch a huge, sweeping, entertaining blockbuster without actually leaving his brain and heart in awe. After spending most of 2016 working on a project that had already been out for a few days, it's safe to say that the results of working on The Departed are pretty impressive. I have to admit, that I had no idea then that the movie would get released, but after looking at the video of the trailer, I'm very happy about the results. The film is a beautiful piece of work, and it can be enjoyed with everyone.

After doing our quick rundown of The Departed online on Monday, we would like to share some updates from the movie.

One of the most anticipated trailers of the year for The Departed was a scene coming from a deleted scene on a ship. This was something we hadn't seen at the event, where the actors could have literally told us more of the movie. The fact that they did get the film to a trailer is fantastic, as is the fact that the actors and directors of the film were only two people – Richard Matheson and Michael Douglas – with roles that they made themselves. The trailer shows a massive, sweeping spaceship that will come crashing down from the heavens (literally, we used to think it was the top of a tower in Hollywood).

Another piece of awesome news from The Departed was the release of an additional trailer. While this was just a short teaser trailer of The Departed, it features a bunch of other big pictures from 2016, and the teaser video for the movie also includes a lot of content.

If you've never watched The Departed, this is the most important piece of content that you've never seen. We hope this trailer helps you and gets to know you and make some predictions! Stay tuned!
