After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Magnolia by George Harrison and Annie Egan (1927). I don't know much about George's and Annie's parents besides the movie script and their early friendship to William Haynes and Robert Pattinson (I'd say George's parents may have played a crucial role in shaping Harrison's father Frank Pinto's character, Peter Pan, which I've also yet to encounter). They both play a major, or even major, role within the narrative of Magnolia. So I've not been very impressed by anything by George when asked about this film.

But there are a few interesting factors to consider if you can be an interested observer of films like this. One is that the story itself is a fairly straightforward one. At this point, it's too soon to tell if the story is a particularly good or an awful experience or if that was just a way to get around a little bit of the plot in the first place. Perhaps it's just more that the writing has a much more interesting flow or has some of that more original, original feeling. Perhaps it's that this is just George's first film of having had the chance to get his hands on this novel. It would have some advantages in terms of not being as easy to get into as it is in other adaptations -- not that the actors are too well written, but there are some things in there that are in danger of being too much for some people who've already spent a lot of time playing characters who really aren't just nice, friendly, well-respected people.

Finally, it's worth pointing out that in early drafts of this book, some writers suggested that George might also come up with a way to translate "Harry Potter" into what might be the best English language word in the movie. This kind of thing (and other things) gets put down as being off-putting! There was a time, in the mid-1990's, when George and Hermione were doing a couple of very strange stories in the first English-language book, The Boy Who Lived. What made the story so fascinating was how Rowling thought Harry was so brilliant that it wouldn't be weird when she translated it into Russian. George had been looking to do a translation of this book in a British comic book when Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince began in 1998. George and Hermione didn't want to mess around with that (and they did.) The original book didn't get translated till the middle of 2014, that has to be the last time anyone spoke English well, and this is the earliest one that Harry ever did in his entire life.

One question has come up during all this writing: what would you write George Harrison's screenplay for? I'm almost certainly going to write it for a novel first and give it a very strong tone. So, say I'd write these stories in English first (perhaps I'd take a hint from The Dark Knight to make that sound even more familiar), or just a lot of English first. I'd give Harrison the rights to a lot of this story and even a little bit of other stuff. I'd give him the rights to almost everything in this book! Also, I'd put enough of a big chunk of it from George Harrison's script into the movie itself so that it wouldn't cause any problems for the production and the writers. The idea here is that George Harrison didn't exactly get the rights; he did, in fact, work with the actors himself to have them work together, so that the story wouldn't need to be in English first.

In any event, I have a few suggestions for George, so if you want to read it, I'll be sure to keep you up to date.

A lot of George's scenes in the movie are really beautiful. He has a really, really, really good character, and I have to say, just looking at his movie's poster doesn't make me feel too bad about that, either. I still recall his face coming up because the next time I looked at the poster for A Wrinkle in Time and I saw the poster for A Wrinkle in Time, I was so thrilled!

Another great part of George's performances is that he's a really good singer. He has a big voice that takes up a lot of space in this movie with these great vocalist vocals in a voice I just don't understand yet. At the beginning of the game, I thought there'd be some kind of huge, beautiful emotional outburst in the movie, which somehow ended up in the movie itself and in the movie itself. He's one of my favorite parts of this movie, as he's the only singer, and he's the only singer who's even sounding like he could sing and would feel like he could. George has a really good singing voice and I was just thrilled to hear his voice sounding so good.
