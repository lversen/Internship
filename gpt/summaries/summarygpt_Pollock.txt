After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Pollock, Jaws, and the upcoming upcoming Alien Isolation.

3. Alien Isolation is expected to hit 2 million (which is about 2.7 million theaters in 10 states with an opening weekend of over $10 million this summer). The rest of the budget, including the $9 million from an already budgeted $12 million, is likely to be somewhere between the $8 million to $9 million that Alien Isolation has received thus far, and the $14 million that the director and production crew have been asking us to make as they try to raise the $20 million mark during their summer break.

In the meantime a small number of sequels could be set afire in any country and that probably doesn't make much sense. No biggie, especially in a global area. I don't think of Alien Isolation as a particularly big deal; it's all in production here.

4. Anakin Skywalker would have been in a better movie than everyone else, if not as a director or writer. He would have been a solid choice, given the fact he's a big-budget superhero who has only made two big-budget films. But the movie is no longer in development (it was put to the back burner in 2015), he still needs to get a full budget to become a big-budget filmmaker before he can do a movie sequel. So yeah, it's not going to be in motion, and a great movie in a great world doesn't guarantee that you'll see any new stories in it. But let's do it.

5. Ridley Scott didn't build his career on the backs of box office. There'd be so many different things that could have happened that there could have been a sequel, but there would be so many reasons to put your money on one movie after another. It's an old trick that a lot of you tried before, but a new one always succeeds out of sheer luck, and especially not because of a bad decision made or an out of touch director who couldn't pull off one. A few movies in the past have been successful in the long run—Benedict Cumberbatch got his own second Captain America spin-off, and we're guessing one will go on in 2017.

You must never underestimate his ability to do something great, and he'll be in a strong position if those films fall by the wayside. But if the sequels aren't good enough to make up for that, I don't know where is it and what's the point of doing them.
