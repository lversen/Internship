If you're curious about how I ended up like my heroine, read this book:

The First Child

(This was a prequel to Up in Smoke, which was written by the same author.)

I was the first child of a family and there was one of the teachers there I never knew. But I loved it. I loved when a few boys at the school told me I had to work for her, the most embarrassing thing was if I got any homework done and I got punished. I thought this was because they hated me.

I wasn't really sure who they actually thought to be punishing me for my actions. I didn't know if anyone with a conscience, I didn't have much to prove I was wronged or whether my sister was even right.

In life, a parent is not always the only person with an opinion that can influence others. You see that in my story "Myself In the Bathroom With My Uncle," I had a really wonderful aunt, and my stepmother was a great lady I loved, too. And my stepmother was also a great person, and my granduncle knew about the dangers she worked to keep their baby safe and that what she did was only to keep them from doing what they needed to be doing.

It's very important to you to know your own feelings. The only way to learn more about yourself is to make your own choices yourself. Do you believe your feelings are right, or do you have to get back into your normal life so I can be that person?

What do you think of this book? Can you have it or not? How would you choose to have it?
