After this input give a synopsis of this movie: A Night at the Opera, based on A Night at the Opera, directed by Jurgen Tocchini. It takes place in the 18th-century city of Casara de Souza. It has the sound of a theater but the visual quality is very similar to The French Opera. It takes place in a small cathedral where opera performers perform on drums, and the stage is decorated with candles. The performance focuses on a girl named Anna. Anna is the protagonist of this movie.

As expected, at the start of the musical, "Funny or Die," it depicts an actual real ballet, in which the dancer is described as having a certain form of "magic," which was an inspiration. In this episode, the protagonist of the movie performs a trick that was used for the ballet.
