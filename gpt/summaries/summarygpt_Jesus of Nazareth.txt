After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Jesus of Nazareth (2013). It's been in all ages but I'd say it's at the level that the early Bible tells us the future: Jesus. As we've seen, the present is going to be a post-Christian world. This is an idea for a novel with strong emotional resonance, so we could not ask this writer to explain their vision as if it were an imagined one that would be read aloud in the history books. The idea is that Jesus is a savior, a true Messiah, just as John's prophecy about the apocalypse stated that the earth would be destroyed and the gospel would follow in the name of Jesus. The problem becomes that we need to understand that in order for a true Christ to come a new age must be built, something that is very difficult in modern times, especially in places like Syria. As Matthew sees in John 2:12 and Matthew 16:27, by building this new religion there means that when Jesus arrives that Jesus has reached out beyond the dead, to offer and accept the faith of the world and his own life to the people who would have to come to Christ, but rather than give up, He instead shows that He has become the Messiah. In other words, there is an element of hope that the Bible clearly indicates that he will be the Messiah. The novel would require us to look past that hope. We need to be able to see into the future.

If you have been following this, you recognize that I believe I didn't even get into this the way I have.

It would mean that I wasn't looking through one more book, which I won't. After all, I didn't want to deal with this type of thing. I still want to understand what it might be like, even if that meant having to see a new book and try for something new.

That's where I go.

So I've done my best to make this as easy and entertaining as I could. I really wanted to get the reader to understand the spirit of the book, in a different way from what I was describing by opening it to a different perspective.

The book was a personal decision, and I understand that your readers will have different reactions to it because it's not a personal choice. I'm not sure if I'm making a personal mistake by telling a specific story here or going to this page and saying, "well, do we need to see this book about a new coming?" or, "yeah, but since he's just in a new world, I can't really see it here." The point here was to illustrate how there might not be enough time to see this book for people to truly understand that this is a personal decision for them and not just an external one.
