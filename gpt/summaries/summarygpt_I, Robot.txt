After this input give a synopsis of this movie: I, Robot: The Movie, was looking forward to watch this movie together. I was really curious about all the things that I could expect from this movie. As soon as I read all of the info, I was going to ask myself the question, "How did this movie come about. Did the movie make its way to you when it was a little more than a year?". In short, it really didn't make for a great movie but I think the idea is that it was a short and it's not bad at all. The movie is a little bit more comedic but not too bad, but it's not the worst. In this movie I felt more confident and confident in my life.I enjoyed watching this movie but did not enjoy it because I wanted to see it again. I think it's a movie that you watch all the time and will watch again. In retrospect, it was disappointing that there was this movie.
