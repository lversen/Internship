After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Lincoln: "Omni-Awareness" (1942), The Great American Novel, starring William Shakespeare, James Dyson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

A lot has been said about Memento Man. Here is a sampling:

A little more than six months after Lincoln's assassination at the age of 51 (the month of April), we had the last look at the film, a stunning (and even disturbing) look at something that never happened. The most intense scene from the opening sequence – where a doctor shows up dressed as a king and a servant (with a long beard and all the requisite hair) – is in the title sequence, where we see that the king's office still sits empty, surrounded by the dead. Yet, it is so important we have to see what he thinks. All of this – and other elements of the film's central plot – are the result of Lincoln's political awakening, or what was once the American dream once again became reality. Here are three major elements of the film. In fact, our "American dream" was born more than a generation ago. Lincoln is not only elected into office in March 1940 as the newly elected President of the United States, he is also the first African-American to be elected to the Presidency of the United States for thirteen years. The first African-American president in the New Deal era received his degree in political science from Oxford University and his degree in political science from Harvard University. And at 66 he served as a congressman for the House of Representatives from 1859 to 1869. And in 1893 he was elected to the United States Congress, which was elected in a 4-4 split (one party to one candidate and one to one party on the other.) The first African-American presidential nominee in history was Abraham Lincoln Jr., who was a Republican in a 1912 presidential race. Lincoln was re-elected with a large, 13-point (70 percent) majority to become the first African-American president in US history. That was a major victory for the Republican Party, but it marked the beginning of the long and glorious struggle to build a movement of black workers. In our own times we have fought back, and won big wars, fought in international wars and in wars on the wrong side of history. We have fought our way through struggles and triumphs in all kinds of other fields. In fact, in most countries as well as in the rest of human history there have been struggles and victories for a long time. But it is important to remember that there has never been a political awakening on our part. At least no one has asked us to take up such struggle on a national level. We do that by raising the funds, in various ways, to bring the people of South America together and to unite our struggles on this continent. But no one has asked us to get into this race. And we have made the ultimate decision - that we will not go on to be part of the struggle, simply because we have failed to win a political revolution. The great American Dream never lasts too long, and the only way it ever lasts is that Lincoln makes us an example for the rest of humanity, who at least want to see our dream come to fruition.

This is a great, disturbing and surprising experience. From that moment, the public took it as a challenge to the White House to end slavery, not only slavery under Reagan but also any form of immigration (especially illegal and unethical). What's surprising is that most are not surprised that their response was not so simple.

There was a group of writers, some of them students, that would like to see the release of this film. (We're not sure how that's possible, but I think it's going to be interesting. As some commenters mentioned, this film has already been posted on our site before). What's more, they're organizing this movie to coincide with the beginning of his first term at the U of T; the student group is seeking to promote the film "as a message that we cannot support a president who does not believe in fundamental fundamental freedoms and rights."

There were also some good comments from writers on social media. However, that's a great first step forward in this effort.

Thank you, Lincoln himself, for the inspiring work of these brave Americans. Now, we are going to go through the film with some serious respect for Lincoln as president, as he prepares to take over in 2018 and begin his first term.

Lincoln and his team believe that he was inspired by the work of the South at that time, and we have a special place in our hearts for being able to put this film on the world with those people who contributed so much, because they are all heroes.
