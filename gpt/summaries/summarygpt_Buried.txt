After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Buried in the sands of Mars is a story of human sacrifice, heroism and survival; from every conceivable angle we learn about a strange world, which is only beginning to emerge.

It is easy to see why James Cameron was eager to deliver such a story to so many audiences. For as much fun and characterisation as the film's success offered, his failure to make the best of a bad situation and in his time as CEO of Sony Pictures Classics and as a producer of all the big names in the Hollywood cinematic world gave the film wide praise despite the great problems with its plot (such as the bad ending), which proved to be a major problem later in its run through the years.

I am not arguing that the screenplay is bad. Indeed, the film is indeed terrific - in its own right great - and the writers and director can say what they want when it comes to making good films, and have done so for decades now. That would give us a much better sense of where the studio, at its heart, is going next.

That is, if the script is bad.
