After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Mystic River (1985) is based on John E. Wilson's short story A World Before Time, which is in the vein from The Wind Rises and I have read the screenplay by Joe Rancic and is actually about an island filled with magic people. I cannot say a word about the ending as it may come to a surprise to those expecting it. (You can read the original version of the quote below.)


The world is changing, the cities are expanding, there is no stopping magic; and the people are all the happier, wiser, more peaceful. This is the main premise, but there are many more twists in it. We see the children (of all ages) are going to the local market for magic items to make a profit, while they are going on their own adventures in the city. We hear the kids will play in the forest or in the woods and watch as people make magic (as far as the local towns go). We hear about a big city with magic in it and many other bits as well, all of which are explained and expanded upon in stories we know little about. I believe this is one of the most important films of the past 40 years.

And this was the premise of this movie. It is that powerful. It has huge ideas that no other movie has: a world in a big city surrounded by monsters, small towns, and things of supernatural quality. And yet it manages to weave that all together in one stunning and emotionally engaging story, with one thing that leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe even more so than most of its other great films. That something is that, as a child I have never believed if I will see Magic: The Gathering ever again. Yet I cannot deny that I would be excited about it if it were to get it made this year.

I have spent a lot of time reading the script, thinking about how I could make it work. I have also been given the opportunity to write and produce many "magic stories" in my free time. The more I read, the more I realize that those stories are inextricably bound together through the whole story, not just the individual actions of one individual. This was why I have been compelled – and asked for – to put together a big and amazing project. The biggest book I ever read was The Wizard of Oz – and I am excited to re-release that book this year. I have an entire project awaiting me (both to finish what I already wrote and to re-adapt it to become a real and lasting piece of my life) and looking forward to the day I read it again.

So, I have an ambitious dream of making one in my lifetime to produce that book. That's my approach. And it will be a thing of beauty on any level with Magic: The Gathering (other games may offer a different take on the game and I can't imagine competing with one of those). I may never actually find out what that book's title is, but here it is: Magic: The Gathering: Complete Quest.


I'll be writing a series of short stories based on my research and experimentation with the game. A set is about 20 pages long with about 400 pages to keep track of the story flow and the characters of each side. The game is about a small island, and the people on it are all trying to solve complex problems with their lives

What if I went on this journey and told my children that their lives and the city of Noxus were my dreams? What if I told them that my children always wanted something from the game? They would be more than happy to see something from the game, as well as from Noxus, though it would not be my dreams or my dreams at all. And then, with the help of a bit of work done by me, they can learn about the story, and then go on to finish the story together. In those words,

Magic: The Gathering: Complete Quest – The Story Behind It is written and illustrated by Dan Savage, Joe Rancic, Jax Reitz, Josh Stiegman, Joe Breslin, and Josh Green.

The Game of Magic is my story about the journey that I have taken in creating this game and the stories that I have written and produced over the years and have had the chance to write. I love and adore my work, and I always try to express my love and appreciation of every aspect of it by making sure everything about the game is a pleasure for anyone with an interest in the subject. This book will take that a step further, offering my story and characters my children to enjoy, while also being able to make them feel like true Magic believers along the way.

I have also taken my children to spend an extra week together, because I will be able to keep them
