After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Mona Lisa in A Bug's Life (1991) from the opening credits. When the production producer heard that the script had to be rewritten, he was in his office and called the production manager, who looked up at him and said: "How should you make it clear that it was a good idea?" The writer came back out and said: "We had too many things going on here to just jump ahead and let it go, and then we just need to make these movie with the money and the creative energy that comes with being creative." So the director cut the credits and made a short film like A Bug's Life while still retaining the material.

That same year the movie won the Oscars and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.
