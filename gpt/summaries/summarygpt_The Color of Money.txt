After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Color of Money by Charles Darwin (1926) The Science of Evolution by Carl Sagan, The God Delusion by Philip Pullman, The End Times by Robert Heinlein, The Man Who Saw the Light: What We Know About The Universe by Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion and The Universe and the Universe: A Quest for Knowledge by John Searle

Note: I suggest this movie should be read with a wide view, especially if you enjoy science fiction, especially in the form of stories told of a human-like being, called an extraterrestrial. Even though it is a science fiction story, it still does not explain the Earth.

Here are some examples of a few examples of science fiction that can be thought from an extraterrestrial point of view:

THE WOODDOG — "All Things Dormant" by David Foster Wallace (1949) A new twist on the classic story of a forest fox that wakes up in a swamp near San Diego. He is sent over by the "Distant Planet" after he is rescued by a mysterious group of monkeys from a swamp in Mexico. This "Distant Planet" is an extraterrestrial entity named The Wood Dog, and the apes use his DNA to create one of its most sophisticated versions of life forms. It is one of the most well-documented of its kind.

THE DOLPHIN THE TRIGGER — "The Big Idea" by David Foster Wallace (1942) A novel whose plot hinges on the question of a worm that turns into a human and is able to travel through time. It begins with a story about an extraterrestrials in space attempting to gain a foothold in space before being killed by a computer called the Xanth. The Alien was discovered, and by now all hopes of landing upon the planet are over.

THE WILDERNESS: FOUR FESTIVALS — "EIGHT" by John Cage (1931) A classic novel about a mysterious world inhabited by humans with unusual psychic powers and a curious genetic trait. It starts here with some information about a man named Aung San Suu Kyi, a scientist of great distinction who came to the United States as a teenager from the Indian subcontinent to study medicine.

THE WILD MACHINE — "LITTLE WIND" by Paul F. Tompkins (1936) This is a story about a forest fox that is sent over by a monkey named The Wild Machine. It begins here as a normal day. But the monkey is sent back by a group of monkeys with a plan to turn them into the WILD MACHINE. The monkey gets to keep a secret from one of his other team of monkeys on a remote island, and they get to kill The WILD MACHINE. It appears to be a great film, but the fact that the monkey is in his human form means it is not meant to be. It also makes us know where Toontown, NJ, really is; you had to go down to the beach there!

THE WILD MAN — "DREAMING" by David Foster Wallace (1940) What happens when you ask a scientist whether the universe is a reality? He replies he thinks that the universe is, and you get the feeling that the universe is not reality either.

THE WOLDERING DOG — "THE WORSHIP WILD" by Edward Maunder (1942) This film tells the story of The Wild Duck of the woods when I was a young man. It is based on one of the classic stories of The Wizard of Oz, John Wyld. The title comes with the title "THE WILD WOMAN," which means "One Woman of The Woods".

THE WHITE FELDER — "WESTON" by David Foster Wallace (1985) A film about the birth of a human and apes in a desert with a long and slow descent into chaos. It features a story about the birth of Aung San Suu Kyi, the chimpanzee that is on trial and now is being held up for a ransom. We learn there was a great deal of hope, and eventually his trial was overturned.

THE WOLDERING DOG — "WILD" by William Faulkner (1989) The most famous of all of those old movies, this one follows the story of a monkey living in and out of space. The apes find out that it is a man named Robert Heinlein who was born in space. It is shown the monkey will become a human when he grows up. The monkey can return to his human form soon afterward.

THE WILD WOMAN — "THE MIND OF LIONS" by William Faulkner (1991) This is a story about a man who is sent over to his human and an ape
