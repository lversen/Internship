After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Wayne's World

This movie makes its way from the comic book to television during the final battle between Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, where he must fight Voldemort in person while his friends fight the demon Lord Voldemort. Harry is presented with a very simple and straightforward storyline. He's told this fact by several different characters, including Harry's dad, the late Donnie Yen, and his adoptive grandparents. However, each of these characters is slightly more complicated in some way, and when they are confronted by a threat they immediately start a dialogue similar to the one in chapter 4: "When he had made that call to tell them that they would be getting some sort of punishment or a death sentence for the following days, they could have told him they were getting some sort of punishment or death sentence that they liked. Then he would have told them why they were there and I could have talked to them about which kind of thing Harry had told them in the past."

That leaves only two possible interpretations of the scene. The first one is a sort of death sentence or some sort of punishment for those involved in the killings, and the second one is an attempt by Harry and his friends to make them learn something about the world of the Wizarding World to avenge the deaths of his grandparents and his parents.

I didn't look at the comic book ending. In our experience, comics of this type generally come off rather lighthearted, with some really strong themes and characters. However, I was in for a nice touch in that some of the lines were clearly wrong because of the tone of the comic. On the other hand, I couldn't help but wonder if the fact that Wayne was present during this fight, and not Harry, and did not understand his father's message didn't mean the movie was somehow insensitive. So, if you need something that speaks to a bit of the plot, read on and see if you can appreciate if any of this could be done about the comic (or just go get one with a better soundtrack). It was a very good movie to watch and will likely be available on DVD, PSYCHO, and TV here in the U.S. for that year.

8.00 / 10.00

I wish I could say that this movie was based mostly on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but that wasn't the case, and with several different voices trying to get it right, the movie wasn't great. The dialogue, the fight from that movie, it was a little lacking, and the characters just couldn't keep up. The plot wasn't that great overall, and it wasn't as enjoyable on my watch, but it was still great. I would still recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of the comics.

Rating:

8.6 / 10.5

There was even some good content for you here on E! Online, where an old school story like some kind of "story" of this kind was told from another perspective, and it was much less dark than the recent (and very much darker) films. And as I mentioned, a lot of the humor was given by the character, and his life and death were handled from a story point of view. The movie had a lot of character development too, and as an adult I could tell he's a very good actor, but he isn't the face of the action, he just acts like it. Although, if you want to go down this path and see how he reacts to the world around him, read on. As I said before, I couldn't recommend this film enough though, and it was way too dark to be enjoyable.
