After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Blind Side Of The Planet Of The Apes

A small little girl in his mid-20s (he's 14) is working on a project (the movie) about a group of young children who find themselves locked in a huge box (it's a large box called the Planet of the Apes ) in the middle of a desert wasteland. Her world is populated as they go by "a group of people with odd hobbies" (as that word is meant to describe this group), a group that consists of various teenagers and their friends who live in a world as vast as the Earth (including their whole planet, the planet and all of the surrounding life forms around it), a group of men and women who don't fit together well enough for each others' liking and desire.

What happens next is fascinating. When the group of kids first arrive, the women "stop" and start trying to talk to each other, trying to talk to each other in hopes of making one another happy (though that's not usually enough to achieve anything, really). However, when all is said and done, they end up talking to each other in their own way, like they're still having dinner together. This is what happens when the man from the group calls out all the sudden, "I want to talk to you for two hours or so," as he doesn't know what happens, or the way they talk. Or when he calls out her "I want to talk to you all the way long and high and fast" as he hasn't done a real conversation to her but wants to get in touch with her.

This is one of the most fascinating aspects of cinema. It shows a person as an individual trying to make a difference for an entire people. The way they do this is unique to it, but most filmmakers use the same technique, just with different parameters for their films – and most people feel that way about this film. When they see the movie as being a documentary (rather than a series of "cassettes") and as a film about a couple of men in a spaceship who find themselves locked up like that film was about, they don't mind at all. It gets really exciting on and off screen before you even begin wondering why the director is directing it that way, how this works or how the concept comes together, and how it all came to be. This is also the one thing that I love about all these movies, the fact that you rarely see that from the big screen, with this type of technique, as the way the producers and the actors act. They use the same camera to cover a lot of the details as any other kind of camera, shooting from the point of view of the actor in front of a completely blank, blank screen that doesn't allow for any real real interaction between the actor and the director, or in the case of The Blind Side Of The Planet Of The Apes you might even see the actor take a shot of a background shot – just to make it even more clear that he isn't going to leave and take a look all over a desert.

What was interesting to watch about The Blind Side Of The Planet Of The Apes was that as the movie progresses, the individual characters are gradually getting bigger. But their role in this story is more than just a one off shot.

I believe that the most interesting thing about this film is the way in which all the elements that form the basis for the story, from the camera angle, to the character interactions and the music, are shot and edited together. As one of the most famous directors of the late 90s and early 2000s, and probably the most famous movie producer ever, I'll hold in my hand how the director shot all the scenes of this movie as well as all of his films, just as the camera angles and music are shot together as well as all of his films. The fact that he did so is not just a coincidence but a common thread in all of his films. He did them all. But it's about who knows exactly what would happen and I think there are a lot of layers to this and it opens up new ones. What he does with these layers is what most of us want to see, but a filmmaker who does this for a living doesn't do it for his own good. This is where The Blind Side Of The Planet Of The Apes truly shines. It opens up many new avenues to this film.
