After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Garden State in the Middle:

If you can't do it, you can always tell people that you were really the one who wrote the script for it and they'll say "it was that good" right then.

At the end are some more quotes from the film:

I loved this one.

It would be unfair to say I disliked it because it was such a huge success in Japan and this movie is so good, but for me it just goes to show we have this mindset of "we're good enough in this movie without giving the audience the opportunity to watch the rest of our lives."

For you the critics who said the movie failed because it wasn't good and for people who said it was okay; then I'm sorry. If you don't like it by this date and then you give it your all you'll be fine.
