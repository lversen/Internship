After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Anchors Aweigh, an American film set at a time when the military of the United States of America is at war over Central America, is a comedy about two women dealing with a terrifying situation of domestic abuse. For the opening scene it's going to be about one of the two protagonists, Claire, the mother of two. And the opening scene is not going to be about a single child, or a single woman. It's going to be about one of the most fascinating and powerful moments of film ever (there's a lot happening in that second scene where Claire sees the whole thing, then she sees the trailer and, oh, it's beautiful). The script is a little slow- paced. The editing of this movie is a little clunky. It's not like it just comes out. It has a certain amount of drama. It has a lot of action. It doesn't do very well. It had enough suspense. It didn't tell what happened, it didn't make sense to me. I have to give it a 10 or under rating because I would have liked for it to have done better in its ending. I'm not saying it is. But the idea was for a movie that didn't really tell how the characters would react, and wasn't about them reacting. It was about the family. It's the same thing. You really go in there expecting something, and you do it right away because it's so obvious. It's not that it wasn't a movie about family and how families handle abuse. It was a movie about a family, which isn't easy to see, and that family handles it and what has happened in this life is something that happens and it takes this family at its finest, and that is how I came here to this movie - how I had family. It wasn't a family movie.

The trailer, The Shining, contains lots of disturbing scenes, but the most damning scene comes from a scene in which the mother of Claire meets with her brother, George, a former CIA-trained assassin. George's daughter, Mary Magdalene (played by actress Carrie Fisher) is seen in the trailer, which she took after the movie went down. It had been reported that while filming, her mom was watching The Shining on the Internet, and later when she learned that there was too much porn, she found out that she had been secretly filmed with her older brother. And, as you can imagine, she was furious. It upset her. She got into a fight with her husband. It upset her. She got into a fight with George. And, I had a daughter and I felt so helpless. I went to the bathroom with my kids. I knew something was off about something, or I got angry. My wife left and I went home. I called the kids to the school. They told me I would miss the movie. I did not. And, I don't want to get into how George went this way. I want to say that there was no animosity. I didn't have a sense of guilt. I just felt powerless. I was scared. I didn't know where, or what, or if, or how. And a lot of those scenes were about George and Mary and Mary alone.

Aweigh is an Oscar-nominated movie about a small town in the Northwest of the U.S., so that means it's nominated for numerous nominations, among them, for that movie. It's a strong contender for the Academy Awards. I know this because I've seen The Shining one more time. I read a lot of The Shining. I talked to all of the people who watch what the director said. He said, "We are seeing a much different character. There are different elements of the world I'm seeing around this story." It also said something that I've never heard before about what The Shining looks like.

I remember being at one of the movie's screenings just after the movie started because I saw a piece of the movie that was at my parents' house. The movie was titled, The Shining 2: A Time I Was There. It was about The Shining, and then it had three parts about this little town, and you know one part, and you know the other parts, and it was about three women in a group of seven. And I had this little girl, who, she was just a cute girl, but it was her mother, and she had to live with those issues, and she was a good mother to this little girl. And I saw this little girl, and I could see some very real emotion. And I remember thinking to myself, is this a story about these dysfunctional, incestuous people who have to live together on their own, you know, on their own, but they also feel like they have to make choices to give themselves the right to
