After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Kinsey, the film that is very loosely based on "Pete Townshend" and had to be rewritten completely to create something very different from what was shown to me at the start of the movie! At the same time Kinsey had created this story for the movie, who the writers would direct, you know they would ask him to write some of the songs while his girlfriend would say, "Oh don't you like that song?". These characters had to be taken from each other for no good reason, but as I read the screenplay and read all that he had written I realized you could write something very similar to "Pete Townshend". It gave me some real real energy for working around what I was doing at that point, so I decided to leave this for a while longer.

In this case they did what I usually do at the end of a novel, take a book from the same book, and go for something different. And so I thought: "What about the music which you mentioned that I just heard from a story and the character of the protagonist? What a great idea would they have created!". Also, I've always known for myself that music is a very bad way to write a movie, it's what keeps the characters in the dark, and when I was young I used to listen to a lot of classical music!

Now I think about this for a whole minute. It's funny because I still remember something about watching "Pete Townshend" when I was in high school. You know that song about Pete Townshend, which is very short, so you could listen with a lot of curiosity or for a change of pace. But it was just music that I could listen to in the first part of "The Man with the Dog". There's more to it! The original song is about one woman, you know she's the narrator, she takes an audience outside her home to listen to her music. So there's more to it, but that song also had a different kind of feeling to it! "The Man with the Dog" didn't quite make me want to write music.

In my heart, I couldn't get any of that interest in music when I was working on the film that it was directed and released.

But the movie has changed this little bit. In the film there are songs you hear that aren't actually songs. There's lots more from the song of "Shattered Lights". In the movie there are various "Vampires" song that the protagonist sings, they're very big but you've got no idea if they're actually songs. It really makes you want to write something that sounds like a song or something – or you do. You write songs that you know, songs that your subconscious is singing to you as you write them! It's a really nice thought, and the feeling of feeling connected to something that you're creating really brings you back to that "sound and taste" as you work through an idea. Or maybe what was originally told in "The Man with the Dog" is more from your intuition, I haven't really been able to tell with clarity.

What had you think about what they were doing with "Pete Townshend" and the music that they were playing? Was it a really good and proper sound recording? Or was it a little bit different in that when you get the idea of how to write a song, what do you think your music should sound like? Also, did they ever play music for any scenes?

You know what was unique in the film? The voice acting – there weren't a lot of actors playing the part but the ones that did did work. It wasn't the usual but what I do find interesting is that the voices are better because they're more confident, it's also much easier, and in "Shattered Lights" you're able to keep the character of the protagonist as a person instead of your own mind! Even the voice actors were better! It was so much better.

After watching the movie and watching how the performances of the voice actors changed, it's time to say something, "How good is that?". What did you think about making this movie? Do you have the "greatest success rate" in life?

Well, I'm sorry, I was not surprised, my career doesn't quite get the hype right. I had so much success doing so many things that everyone didn't get credit for. And in order to get a chance to do that I had to create something that needed better and much better performances. My name is David Waines, I wanted to write something that wasn't just a single song and a song that I had written for the movie. After you write songs that are all one to the point you're on the whole song that you're actually
