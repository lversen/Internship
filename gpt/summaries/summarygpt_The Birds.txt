After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Birds Are Talking, by James Patterson, which I have also reviewed in various venues, and on Soundcloud, as well as the short video that appears in this website.

The short, also known as The Birds Are Talking, was nominated for an Outstanding Picture Award and nominated for a Best Picture Award.

On June 7, 2006, Steven Spielberg wrote an article for the New Yorker that quoted Patterson's own words about the movie. That article was "In its own way, it's as important as telling what happens in a movie without trying to tell what's actually going on in a real novel (and even better, without trying to tell what you don't understand)," though the two are not close friends. The New Yorker did not, however, ask Patterson's friend David Schumacher for an interview; therefore, he did not write for the book on which he gave the information.

By that time, the director was already considering other films, including The Social Network, which was released on his website in 2002. The movie starred a young, female protagonist in the fictionalized version of the original story and starred Brad Pitt, who also starred in the short.

In the end, Patterson had done very little in the way of editing or direct-producing the movie. Although he admitted that, despite using the technique in its real life, the script was good, Spielberg had no control over it, so they couldn't release it. Spielberg reportedly contacted Spielberg with his objections.

The short was released in the United States on June 15, 2007, with the only subtitles included, "As an old film, The Birds Are Talking" and "The Birds Are Talking, "which I heard was going to be a very long film," so that Spielberg could concentrate on making that short, which then moved on to the next installment, "Raptor Lives". The short also starred a British writer named Paul Breen. Breen was to play a British detective named John Whipple, and Whipple's performance featured a black man in front of a camera. According to Schumacher, the short had had very little press, and in fact, it may have been cut from its draft if the film had been released in another medium, such an English video, and if Schumacher hadn't been able to get approval from Schumacher, they considered doing the short for themselves.

Birds of Prey, a short about the death of a comet that was launched from an asteroid, is scheduled for release on February 8, 2009. It was not actually meant to be a short. But there has been speculation that the film could potentially come back to television after its TV ratings plummeted from 738 to 6,813 as of December 2008, and that such a short would probably be used as an entertainment resource to show people at the International Astronomical Union summit. The short was intended to be a short (if brief) about the deaths of a space shuttle (or the Moon that was accidentally lost during Earth's orbital bombardment at 1547 GMT on December 7, 1980). However, this seems to be a story that never actually occurred, and only recently, for reasons, has the short become widely available. (Here are some of the reasons why it doesn't seem that way.)

Birds of Prey is a film, produced and directed by Steven Spielberg. I do not condone the film, as is common in my industry, and it is just a fun diversion. I had heard about it through "the internet" and had recently encountered a number of people who had read the script and had expressed disappointment and disgust over the way the brief was portrayed in the movie. That makes me think that maybe he thought this was a great idea, or maybe Spielberg, maybe the late Bob Saget gave them a short that wouldn't be out of place in any movie — this may not quite be the case, but I hope the same thing happens here. I just hope they let people have less to say about these things than about the plot, and instead say how cool it would be (if it were about birds, after all). (UPDATE: The film was released on YouTube. See below for a video trailer.)

Patton said, "The Birds Were Talking was a kind of sci-fi short, which wasn't really very short, and for me in many ways just really boring and flat out wrong." Of the short. It was filmed before the movie, as Spielberg and Schumacher were doing with the short, in the late, early 1980s. According to Spielberg, Breen is a French writer. The short was released on July 4, 1980, and had been produced in France during the same period. In
