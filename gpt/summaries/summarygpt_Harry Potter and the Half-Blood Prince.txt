After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2003. A sequel later). Harry and the gang enter a magical laboratory where they find three giant, magical monsters, named Draco Malfoy: the Death Eaters, and Azula J. Krum and Gwen Stacy, as well as a man with the odd and not so nice name. Unfortunately, we have yet to see Draco Malfoy again and the three of them have grown stronger and more powerful, so they fall into the hands of Harry (again, not a sequel story, but a movie about the Death Eaters) and the other three members of the gang, making Draco and Gwen's situation more horrible. After the first two films, however, I am not so sure which film will succeed and it's probably a direct result of Ron's (and I can't see any other reason to use this in this discussion) replaying of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (in which the film is rerecorded to a tape but where it is now deleted). But as the following story progresses, it gets so bad you can't bring yourself to believe this is a reoccurring story. The second movie is almost like a complete, original version of the Harry Potter trilogy, with all its references again and again to each of the three witches and wizards. The character of Rubeus Hagrid is shown at the end of the third film, probably as one of the more powerful and threatening witches, although Harry and his gang end up on the other side of the castle, probably out-running Rubeus in the end. (So, really, that's the only real part of Voldemort's story that he really needs. In fact, the first chapter of Harry will be about this.) Now that we know what we know about the second film, we will start to get serious about the third film, though I doubt that it will be quite what it had initially been. There are a number of reasons to believe this would be the case (if Harry didn't use one of the basilisks once to block his magic in the first film, it wouldn't matter either). First of all, we know that Ron is the Dark Lord and is the one who controls Hagrid's powers. Second, there are many things you can say for sure about all three films. You can't convince me that Ron used all three of those things so much; you can't convince me that Harry took all the Death Eaters so completely out of Dumbledore's grasp. Finally, there's this. The first film is probably the best of the trilogy, and it's very likely that the sequels will follow this course also. There will definitely be things I want to say about the first film, mostly because I like the first film so much, which I don't know if we find ourselves with. However, no matter how much we find ourselves in the second film, I can imagine many things that the first film simply didn't do, a movie in which many people just want to feel bad about themselves. Therefore, I would much rather keep things in suspense, even after what seems like years at the very least.

8 1/3 of a story for a movie of a lot of quality

I think that this is a bad movie, at least on a story-level, and probably in a very serious way. The second film is the weakest of the trilogy, and it will need a whole lot of work to complete its mission of protecting Hogwarts (the Hogwarts Express) and getting Voldemort away. The third film is much more interesting. Perhaps the best part of this trilogy is its sheer quality, even before you read the final four films. The third film can't match the quality of the second film. It takes a LOT of pages to finish, and this really is like trying to do a real story. It also takes a lot of patience to complete, and of course, that comes with many, many other demands. So I hope that you guys are appreciating the story and have a wonderful year of watching movies like this one.

The Dark Lord (1941). A remake of the original 1940. The Dark Lord was the head of House Malfoy, the head of House Malfoy. He was also one of the main architects of the Death Eaters. A retell of that one would be better than the entire movie. The second film was just as good as the first one. A true retelling. The third film is even better. Both films were extremely well made, and many people would have liked them to be. The sequel is better, too, in the very least.

5 The Dark Prisoner (1845). A remake of the 1938 film. The Prisoner was actually about the death on Luna Tower. It never really made much sense, though. The original movie
