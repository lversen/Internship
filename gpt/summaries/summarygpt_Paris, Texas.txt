After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Paris, Texas. At the height of the Civil War and on the morning of Tuesday, October 24th, 1862, a white lieutenant and two enlisted men of the 2nd company were shot on the western side of an abandoned house by the citizens of Paris. The officers were seriously wounded, and those wounded managed to escape. To this day, many believe that no man of color would not be at the front. After an unsuccessful attempt at saving those who had been shot, the Union finally received the commission of Brigadier Gen. Buford for his bravery. He was charged with the duty of command by Colonel W. B. H. Davis, commander of the 23d battalion at Fort Bliss and one of the more experienced battalions in the Confederate army. Since the day of the war, a number of distinguished and courageous officers, leaders, and soldiers have made a conspicuous return to the service.

One of these names was Thomas H. McPherson. Although not born in New Brunswick, Texas, President Lincoln had already informed him of a letter from his friend and fellow-president, and in some respects had made the first contact. (It refers to an article published by Abraham Lincoln in The Journal of the American Socialists, July, 1861.) From the article, read from the lips of those in Congress who had been privy to the correspondence with the president, it was certain that he had made contact with a white lieutenant about some time prior to that fateful day at Fort Bliss and a black engineer. The gentleman, Lieutenant-Commander W. W. Davis, a black and white engineer, was at Fort Bliss for the construction of the new South Carolina border line, and shortly before the battle of Fort Sumter, was wounded in a duel of about 20 fighting men. This wound proved fatal. Shortly after this battle, a French contingent entered the vicinity of Fort Sumter. The American commander, General George F. Marshall, was in Paris as a messenger and was assigned to the South Carolina line. The enemy of the new Confederacy was advancing on Fort Sumter with a large army. (The Americans began to advance rapidly, but General Marshall's force began to move to the eastern side of the line.) A force of three thousand men crossed from Fort Sumter, and General Marshall rode at an estimated speed of about twenty miles an hour westward toward Fort Sumter. (The enemy continued to advance at the head of the line for many miles and it was the southern end of the South Carolina line which was crossed.) Shortly after this, the battle of Fayetteville, Georgia, began. The enemy made a direct attack upon the British forces there on March 24th. The British held Fort Sumter until April 13th when the French attacked the garrison. The Confederates were forced to retreat. During the winter of 1863-64 in the Carolinas, the battle of Fort Sumter in the battle of Fort Wayne was used as a test to evaluate the strength of the Confederate army.

The Confederate infantry regiment was composed of about four thousand men. The number was determined by division and battle strength, as follows:

French Army 1st Regiment 3 1st Regiment 4 2nd Regiment 5 3rd Regiment 6

The French army consisted, on the left, of the 2nd Brigade, which consisted of the 1st Brigade, 4th Brigade, and 5th Brigade, and the 5th Brigade comprised, on the right, of the American Infantry and Special Forces. The 2nd Brigade consisted of the 6th Brigade, 4th Brigade, and 2nd Brigade. The 5th Brigade, consisting of the Brigade of Colonel George M. Cipriano, and the 2nd Brigade of Colonel Charles H. H. Davis were the best infantry regiments to be found in the first three Corps. The infantry regiment consisted of the 5th Brigade and the 2nd Brigade. The regimental commander was Brigadier-General Colonel Charles J. Tisdale. The regimental leader was Lieutenant-Colonel Charles H. L. Olyphant. Lt. Col. Charles A. Wilson, was the first of the 1st Brigade, which consisted of Colonel J. W. Mott, and Colonel J. S. Williams, who were the last two who became regimental commander in the North Carolina line. This line, then in the hands of the 1st Brigade, had, to a considerable extent, been retaken from the German, and the Germans were determined to gain some ground to their position the very next morning. This line continued through the winter. On August 17th, 1864, the 1st Brigade began to advance against the German. On that occasion the regimental commander saw only the right half of the infantry regiment and his order was, "move left." Colonel Johnson was present, and it was the 1st, Brigade which formed the 1st and
