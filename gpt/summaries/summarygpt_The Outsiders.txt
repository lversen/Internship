After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Outsiders takes place in 1947/48. It's a very young girl and has her first sex. She's just 16. The rest is a lot of fun, especially the way they put on a skirt.


(The director, Scott Snyder, had this a few years earlier in his first film, Dark Wings, about a young woman and a boy dating. As this plot section makes clear, he was developing the character as a sort of "candy boy" and that wasn't good for the character.)


Also very sexy is this guy.


This character features the main lead in this play: Robert Cray. When he's very much playing a character in this movie, it's his daughter, Lily. He starts out very much the opposite of Lily, but when she's doing something really smart and interesting, Robert becomes more of a good guy. When it becomes obvious that he's a good guy who could take it as a given, this is really pretty sexy. This little guy is also very nice and fun in his own right. He wears white and gets along with other characters (except for Robert) as much as any of the rest.


You have to go to the beginning of this movie to really notice how great this story is. It is very very well written, a love story, and really not about anything. It does have a great cast of characters and an interesting story about what it took to be an American film. I guess that's what makes this movie so good and it is interesting. The characters here feel like they belong on a certain kind of show, the "American" sort is never really going to be known like it was not for this movie. It only plays to popular stereotypes about American culture because that is something you are not expected to have.


It takes on a different sort of theme every time the script is written.


It's a nice touch that this movie is being played straight. The main character gets involved with a lot of things, a lot of them. In this movie you get to see a lot of different things. The character doesn't look exactly like a normal one, it's something that many of the other characters have in life. This leads me to think this is a bit of a departure. The fact that these characters are so young is not something I would ever be proud of. I would say that this movie is a kind of a step that a lot of people are getting into the process of getting started in their careers with the same kind of stuff that they were taking up.


The main problem I see with this movie is the way things are portrayed. People are often talking about "there's a movie to get you into this, and a movie to get you into writing something that you'd like to read, but isn't really what it is". That's why I was kind of fascinated by this piece of writing that you have to be able to get into the heart of a big question that comes up when you're working as a writer.


There you have that story, a beautiful and interesting story.


I like it. I really do. I think some of the very great work the story has done is to give a true story on the themes in this movie in a way that doesn't just focus on one person but on another person as well. It's great being able to take this from someone else and give it some color. To have a story that is going to be so original and have so many different people tell it and I think they kind of got their own style of writing on the movie. And it doesn't feel like I was saying "It's a really nice movie" or something like that. I think it really did. It takes such an amazing approach to storytelling that is really important to people and is a kind of counterbalance to that type of storytelling.


I'll tell you about the other character who gets involved with lots of different types of things.


He's going to the hospital, and he goes into the hospital with his son. He tells them, "Dad loves you, so why don't you kill your parents?" He says to them. "Well, if you kill your dads, I mean I'm going to be able to kill my parents". It's a very interesting and incredibly unique scene. I really like that this character is going to actually help in a way that nobody else in the movie does or does not do.


That's actually the kind of thing that gets to people. That's why I liked this movie so much. It's a story that has to go deep in its characters. A big story, and I can read a lot of book reviews and how much I like books and the reviews of books are all really kind of different than there is in movie theater. My love
