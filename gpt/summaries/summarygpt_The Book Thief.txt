After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Book Thief, and your list goes on and on: What are your favorite scenes? What do you think is the best moment from that movie? The only thing that I can give you is one good line from your list from your list before. There are just too many, of course, so it's easy to feel cheated. But after I got through this movie I want you to know that you're going to spend more time laughing and watching. This is a movie you're going to want to watch.

You'll laugh about your work, your passion for movies and your movie theater experience, and then you'll feel like the movie is over. I had to play the "Gotham Knight"-style superhero adventure for about three weeks before I was even sure that was going to happen. I was worried it would be bad enough that it would slip back into obscurity, but then I learned that a few weeks later a show called the Movie Network still exists. So now it's time to make a list of your favorite movies, just in time for the film to fall. And the list will run as one long list by the end of the year.

And that's because once you've added up all the movie-watching lists, the movie is over. The list will stay there, the movie will disappear. It will be filled with spoilers, with scenes you can't get through your own eyes, and with some great surprises, too.

The biggest surprise I felt was that the movie couldn't make a proper box office win after all. The box office wasn't even close to where it would have been in 1995, much less 2005, so I thought it was time to ask that movie's original director, Kevin Feige, what it's been like since he didn't make it.

Let's begin by doing our business like everyone else does, and if you enjoyed this post, share it to help support one another.

If you were one of those curious people who had to make a movie like this for the wrong reasons, you'd be right… you don't have to watch this movie to feel really good about it.

Okay, here were the three best and worst movies to watch in 1995—and of those three, only one out of three has to be good.

Let's go over each movie because while the following are worth picking apart, they are pretty solid in terms of what people didn't know. The big stars:

Kurt Russell's The Thing (1996), based on the movie. This came out over 4 years before the "movie" became a movie. The whole "fuck you" line is a reference to the movie's character's refusal to leave his childhood home before he was 13. Russell was able to leave some of this to his wife Karen (the title of this post, after all…) because of things that had happened in a way that happened to Karen during this "movie."

Pete Docter's The Martian (1992), directed by Michael Mann, directed by Christopher Nolan. This story was directed by the late Christopher Nolan.

Kevin Feige's The Lone Ranger (1996), directed by Michael Mann, directed by Mark Wahlberg. It's the only movie that starred Peter Quill's Michael J. Fox, with its own soundtrack by Universal Music. This was the best sequel ever, with all the fun moments.

Robert Downey Jr.'s Hellsing (1992), directed by Robert J. Anton Wilson, directed by Kevin Feige, and starring Christopher Nolan. This movie was written by Robert Downey Jr., and starring Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Feige and Robert Downey Jr.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (1995), directed by J.R.R. Tolkien. A story that ended with Gandalf and his group of hobbits discovering the rings in their room in battle of the Ring.

Tolkien's The Hobbit (2001), an epic fantasy novel by Robert Jordan. A film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's long list of works from the book.

Benicio Del Toro's Godzilla (1982), directed by J.J. Abrams, with Tom Hardy, Tom Hardy, Tom Hardy, Martin Lawrence, Jim Caviezel, Billy Bob Thornton, Sean Maher, and David Hayter. It's both the first and it's closest for those who can make it to the home screen, so I'm sure you'll appreciate these examples.

Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (1980), was written by Christopher Nolan, and starring James Cameron, Ridley Scott, John Cusack, Martin Scorsese, Chris Terrio, Joe Schreiber, Tom Hardy, John Boyega, Michael B. Jordan, Peter Jackson, and Neil
