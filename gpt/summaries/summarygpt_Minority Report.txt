- 4/5 (1/5 stars) It's clear that it wasn't just Fox's original film that was the big winner - it was the original television show. The first time I watched Fox's original TV show I was going to love it. (3 stars!) It certainly seemed as though you'd always have a favorite (or two) of the original TV series. It feels like the first time viewers heard about it from a producer they'll want to listen into, see if they could say "yes". I can assure you this review is my first review so any suggestions you make will do all the good things for Fox - this review isn't on you. If you would like to make a short one I may also recommend your review of Fox's original television show. (3 stars!)

The show's main theme was the struggle between our nation, the people of the USA (where the USA was the greatest). By the end of the show there was nothing really right about the people living there. This was true for all Americans. Some of us, as a group, had a more moralistic view of how things should be.


There was plenty of talk of a world where everybody was free and there were only a small number of people on the planet who needed help. The whole concept of what was right and what wasn't was hard to find. The only reality was an America where a fraction of the people had the knowledge and could help them on the way to safety. It would be an era of many challenges with the rest of the world. The show is about to see what happens when a very poor, oppressed, human group finds out what its "rights" (or "rights") are.


I've seen so many times that I think I've forgotten or given up. The first time I watched this on ABC, I was a little disappointed. I had a feeling that Fox may have been off the mark. The show had a lot of humor, a lot of characters, and an odd mix of the things Fox used in the show. This is not where it could have had a huge impact because I know the audience had their own set of values. There was a lot of political elements at play in the show, but at the same time you had the show being about, well maybe not political, but not political, the American system of government was based on two fundamental principles: 1) Human Rights

2) Empowerment for All:
