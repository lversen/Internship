After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Blazing Saddles 2 by George Clooney/Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was an astonishing, beautiful and incredibly successful adaptation of a beloved 1980s Western. But before we get into that, it would seem obvious that much of the appeal to this film lies in the fact that the original series, and the original film at that, were made by a single man. It's a story of family, the rise and fall of a couple from a single village, and a tale of a family that grows, moves and changes from childhood and adolescence through the final decade of life—or one that can only be won over by a single man.

But in an interview with The Wrap, Clooney clarified that there were other ways of making a movie. He says that he thought the original series could do "a better job" directing the story rather than editing it. "That's right," he says. "In Hollywood when you have a filmmaker that wants to make a good movie, it's important to have a shot at putting this film out there even before the next set of actors." And he thinks that in doing that, he'd come up with a way to give them an opportunity to make their own film. "The idea of directing a movie is to make a story that resonates with a particular audience," Clooney says, "and all the different audiences come to our table and ask things about this movie."

Of course the answer to that is no. Most of the major films in the franchise—and also films like Blue Jasmine, and the new movies like Elysium that have been making it to theaters since 2012—were shot at very high frame rates—most of them with a big frame rate and the same lighting throughout the day—so any budgeted feature film would have seen a very different picture from its predecessors, and to Clooney's surprise the new adaptations of any of those films are still being produced. In addition, the original series was produced on very large screens, and as such made possible a number of low-budget studio productions. The other big hit movies, which may have been released on film, or at least appeared in movies with very high budgets or low budget, may have used high or low production values, but were also produced in small and tiny studios to produce what was considered as high-quality films.

In a way, it's a big deal to think about the appeal of getting a small and intimate film made—and if "Bruno the Humbug" is a good look into that, it would seem like it would be an excellent thing to do. "Bruno" is a wonderful movie, but it comes close to being a classic of 1970s filmmaking—and that's especially true for a film with such minimal or little value. "The great thing is that if you're a small studio and you had the budget of a big studio, I would call it. In many ways, that film is the classic film that went down, and that's what it is," Clooney says.

And then at the end of the day, the most important thing is to have people willing to go to extraordinary lengths to make the film. That's one of the things that makes the success of movies like Blazing Saddles such an even bigger thing. The movies we've seen so far—like Blue Jasmine and Elysium, the new movies like The Big Short, and a few more—were made with no budget. In fact, I'm not even sure that ever happened. In any case, it's difficult to know what to make of "Bruno."

We've done a little movie analysis of "Bruno." Now let's talk about it more. "Bruno" is, in my experience, considered one of the biggest American hits of the moment. "American Horror Story" spawned about two thousand additional viewers—more than a million total, and probably a million more if you factor in the first million viewers that followed. (It even received a five-year run in the U.S. at the box office.) It didn't sell as many copies as the original comic book movie—because the new comic books were more expensive to produce—and "Chronicle" was the biggest grossing movie of 2015, even though it was directed by Joe Dante—but it got a good bit of money, especially considering the massive numbers it went out to screen once. I'm very doubtful if this is a case in point of "Bruno," because they weren't quite as well-received by that period that "Chronicle"—a comic book that was an all-star weekend, including box office success and a huge box office draw—also took a backseat to American Horror Story, the American Horror Story franchise, for that matter. "The Big Short" did
