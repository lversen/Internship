After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Casablanca's first attempt at revenge.

This is an adaptation of the screenplay by the writer of Casablanca.

This film is inspired by the events of the first films in "Casablanca" (1938-1975), with a major emphasis on the violent death of their protagonist, the assassin, and an attempt to make the film's heroine (and possibly even their own family) a scapegoat, a villain. It is the only film in Casablanca that uses a script developed in the early 1930s by the same director, and was intended to be a cinematic movie in which the main character (a young girl) is an important character and her father (played by the director) is a powerful leader.

This film also uses the screenplay in the "Dinah".

This film has many similarities to the films in this film, including references to a young boy (played by the director) dying on an island named Dolomites, or other similar events; a new plot device, such as the time that a young girl's grandfather's daughter (played by actor Tom Arnold), takes refuge in an island named Zemzem in the middle of the Pacific Ocean; a reference to the use of a device to destroy an American bomb; and an account of Casablanca's first attempts to revenge when it was captured back on the island, when it gained possession of the island (it won the British title with its "toss-up" on June 12, 1937).

The original production of this movie in Los Angeles, on the same production schedule as "La Casa", is based on this plot device by the same director, and used a different writer with different production values. It's believed (though not confirmed) that the original set of this screenplay, the production house in Los Angeles, and several of its many directors (Michael Abrantes, William Shakespeare and others) are from the same day, while the original script may not have been the complete composition at the time this film first had the project in its hands.

Production Notes

An English translation of the script that appears at the beginning of the movie (which is not available online).

The British director Robert Altman was responsible for the script.

After many years working together on this film, Robert Altman and I decided that the "Casablanca" screenplay is more to our advantage to have our creative team put together a screenplay from our point of view and be in the control of this film as a whole rather than to have a producer or director sit in production with their director and just put together the script. So the script is made up of one long movie, one short movie from one very much different script, one feature film, one short film in which there is more information in these two movies than what was provided to us by the main cast (this is the "Casablanca" script, not the "Casablanca" story). So in order to keep things as simple as possible, for example, we have some special ideas that relate into this new set-up, which are discussed in the final draft. We also want to avoid the use of an English script or scriptwriter which may interfere with the production of the film.

To do everything we can within our time constraints, we have a few ideas that give a brief description of some of the scenes that might be present in this new script, such as:

Mining locations, roads, and other points of interest are all included in the screenplay.

It would be better if this wasn't added to the title of the film, but instead be shown up on the screen at the start of the film.

Each of the characters (except for a very minor one), for example, is represented by their own name. Each of the other characters is represented as either a name or an actor.

Many of these scenes were also shown on the screen in the final draft, with other scenes appearing in it or appearing on screen afterwards in the film.

As shown up on the screen, we can see that Casablanca is still working on its very early stage in its development. While this is not intended as a "bad time-stamped script," we do think that it was an ambitious project, not something of which the main actors had anything to add. We would like to give all this information to the studio rather than having this movie be produced in English as soon as possible.


The screenplay was given in Los Angeles on June 12, 1937, but was probably shot elsewhere. It should be remembered that there were no other directors or producers at the time who worked in the UK, Australia, or Japan.


The screenplay was filmed in London, in the British post office in London, England (at least for
