After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Iqbal Singh, as the head of the Indian army, is captured by a tribe in the western Himalayan region of Patna. It is then sent to Tihar where they have to make a pilgrimage to Kashmir. But this mission is not as easy as it appears. It takes only about 30 minutes to finish the movie and then the Indian tribe decides to stop there. This is a typical Indian way to torture a person. This movie is a great achievement in the tradition of Indian torture. However, it isn't because of the movie, but because of the director.

The story of the film, while touching on many subjects, does not do justice to the importance of Indian torture. It's not a crime by any means, but it can have a lasting impact on Indian society and the way it is seen in the world. What is even more important is this, this is the first time India has really seen it's own Indians in this movie. This happened before, in the days of Pemba. During the 17th Punjabi War of 1837-39 the British colonial authorities, having heard of the atrocities of the local Indian peasants, began to kill the entire town of Jharkhand. This was part of the army of Pemba's plans of conquest that was launched on 20 July 1837. This would have been in order to crush the Indian movement, which was based on the assumption that it could not be fought with a single Indian force. In the process of this, the British forces started to attack Jharkhand in search of a small army. In this role, the Indians were able to get reinforcements, but the British also attacked the town of Shampang, which was on the eastern front.

The Indian warlord then went to Britain and ordered them to kill people for this purpose. The British took the prisoners and executed them before it could be started again. In fact, these actions did not do justice to the killings in Shampang; the Indian camp at Chaman is surrounded on every side by an immense jungle. The natives of Shampang were quite happy and started to leave. The British were surprised when the locals started to return. Many others were executed. While the British camp was on the western side of the huge jungle, the Indian villagers who helped on the journey began to gather water near the camp, while the British camp was surrounded on all sides by an enormous jungle. This was an extreme act of violence that should not have been performed without the aid of some Indian volunteers who fought for the Indian army during times of war.

For the first time in history our society saw some of the horrors of the Indian Civil War and its horrors. In this film, all the survivors of the fighting that lasted till the end of the war are told about our experiences in the war, while also their lives to come. The victims of the Indian wars are told of all the atrocities that have happened to them since the war began. Every survivor tells his story in the films. There are many important moments and details, but I hope that you will enjoy this film. The ending to the film is so beautiful that it makes me want to enjoy it.

P.S.: This is an all Indian film to share with you, enjoy it, and enjoy your day.
