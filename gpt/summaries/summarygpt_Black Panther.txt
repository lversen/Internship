After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Black Panther – Black Panther 2: Vol. 18 (2015)

Plot: A group of young black characters decide to take out the police and fight for justice for the children. And so begins the second half of the franchise, during this very first season when they take out every old black man from the streets of Chicago. The action of this movie starts at a certain point, between the use of a sword and fists by the young Black Panther who has taken over the streets of Chicago. It quickly becomes to the point as the main events of the movie quickly transition into this movie as the main event is that the main character joins up with other groups of people.

After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Inhumans – Inhumans 2: Vol. 22 (2017)

Plot: On their journey to reclaim their world they learn that the last time they entered the surface of the Multiverse was in 2001. They are surprised by the fact that all of the humans were alive at that time. They learn that the humans from that time were not their slaves. But when they realized that they are their masters, they turned to the multiverse and gave it to humanity. They were inspired by the Multiverse and they were inspired to get back at their masters for their actions.

As this movie progresses from start to finish it quickly becomes more and more thrilling when you remember that the movies started with characters, and now you see that the main character becomes someone that can stand, walk, talk, and talk. So with the main character you realize that he or she is not the only person, someone.

Characters in my previous reviews (and videos) have said that in this movie in all its violence that it's not the other way around, but it also seems that this movie is not like a true black man's action movie. The action is not so much of a fight as the chase and the escape that occurs. The movie is as much about the characters as the fighting.

With the main character you now learn how to become a black man in this movie and how to avoid being shot, how to get lost, how to fight without dying. Through the movies that you see the hero (the main character – who is a real person in this movie) and the villains (and sometimes people like them and just show up everywhere) you also see them become all the more important by becoming more real friends, and who you can be with. By doing as you can with your life, and by becoming an active part of this fight it becomes clear to each of us who is fighting for justice that we actually did all of that fight together. So, as you read this movie your imagination can start to change in this fight. You can become more part of the fight, you can become something else, it's this fight that helps change how we fight for justice.
