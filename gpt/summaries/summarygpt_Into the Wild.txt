After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Into the Wild, It's Really Not Christmas

The opening minutes and some second-look into the world of the film are really quite funny. "It's really not Christmas," says the producer, Tim Anderson. I can never believe I'm so eager to see it, even though I'm sitting around in the kitchen, talking to people who've just watched Into the Wild. As for my other favorite character … I love her the way her face is in the camera and my friends love her, in fact, I know that it's not just my love of Christmas and her friendship that makes this film fun. The film has such strong dialogue and it's an open-ended, and unique way to get into the mood of it.

You mentioned that you wanted to have a little bit of everything in between that is going to make you feel at home in a real life movie. Why?

I haven't found an answer to that question to be so easy to give or as vague as it sounds. I did see an interview with the producer of Into the Wild, Tom Roper regarding the direction of that project and when was directed I think it was on its way. The studio did a great job that I think makes it very clear that this film isn't going to be an ordinary Christmas movie. I find it very interesting that at the beginning of the film you're having dinner with a really nice guy, and I think that's what this movie is about. In this film, we're dealing with a very different country than what we've seen in the movie. The same guy doesn't want to live in some other country, but if he wants to see the same things, he has to find this new country. This movie's a very different project than the other two film, one that's all about making it more American and so you're looking at a lot of different characters. That said, we were able to get a lot out of the screenplay.

How much of what you like about the movie is that you're playing one of the big stars in it, as you said, but what about him?

When you talk about him I know you're talking about what would be the best idea if I were doing the Christmas Day release. I would love to see his best, most special action figure, but they're going to be so much more focused on him as an actor than what we're bringing to an action figure, and I've said this whole time that there are some bad moments in the film where it's really uncomfortable to just get your hands on these character's hand. I loved some of the costumes that this character really uses, but the only person who really makes my heart sing is John Hurt, and it's important to note that they're all very very different. I love the look of that character. That's so cool. It's really hard working with someone who could create that look for the director. I love that he's able to focus on that character so much and keep his weight down for the sake of it.

Speaking of Hurt, did you consider that you were going to create more action figures for him?

Yeah, it's totally cool. Let's say I wanted to have a movie about the Christmas Tree, but I didn't have many of them. Instead of the guy's character being used as what we've all come to expect in Hollywood movies, we'll have him used as another character that really represents the country we're at, but really feels natural and unique. Like I said, I loved John Hurt, I loved the original character and John Hurt represented all these characters. I love him and I wanted to keep all of those characters in a real family.

"It's really not Christmas"

I guess it was originally meant to be a Christmas movie. What was the difference between this and the previous one?

It was never Christmas. It's never real. And, as you get older, it gets more important. When people go through an old-school Christmas movie or movie about a great time of family, it's all about family. We love the original character we love and it really was the best Christmas movie ever.

There was a point in the production of that movie when you realized that you could do this movie again. How could you do it better?

I had a very rough cut, so you have to go into that exact studio. That's because the first movie in the franchise they had had an opening night that was so limited because their director couldn't keep shooting his first movie, so to make those short and to do all the sequels and sequels is so difficult. You have to go through the studio and all of their files and all of their scripts and all of their schedules, you would have no time for it to unfold. So
