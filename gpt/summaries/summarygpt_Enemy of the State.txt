It really feels like something like an old Japanese samurai movie, and this comes straight out of the samurai genre. From its beginning a samurai is a young man who moves around with a large army, and moves on to fight other samurai. Once his life is in jeopardy at a bad time, he sets out to go down fighting. But before he can, he loses his son, and his wife.


From the beginning, the main protagonist, Shurun, (which means "the real" Japanese Japanese name for him) struggles with the past with all of his heart. Through a series of trials, struggles and setbacks he gains everything he ever got...and is saved from being captured, murdered and all the while, making his friends at home, the citizens of the city and a very happy time for all of the time Shurun is without his son. He is, in his final years, raised as a high-ranking warlord and the brother of a powerful prince. But his childhood experience in the war with the enemy was even more traumatic.


So he's trying hard to build up the army, but he falls prey to the enemy while he is still young, a man who is an ambitious and arrogant man, and he ends up with his son in prison. What is his plan before they kill him that saved his son and save Shurun and save everyone of his family from the enemy's evil force even though he's trying to help the people of his home city as well. And when this ends, he's gone back to his son, and he's done with everything. That alone makes this a really interesting movie, and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a movie about the hero of SBS. Helpful it for a time and then it fades forever...just like it does all time.Overall-The first thing one gets about the experience of watching this movie is that it truly is very cinematic, both in terms of size and length, so if you're going to see this, you will definitely love it. The music is pretty good, but it may require some listening a bit to get an idea of its potential.Also the soundtrack is pretty good too, there's an abundance of old titles all in one, like "The Sword of Dandelion" from the SNAFU soundtrack. Helpful it for a time and then it fades forever...just like it does all time.
