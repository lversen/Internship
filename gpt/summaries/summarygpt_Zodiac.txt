After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Zodiac Killer, directed by Michael J. Fox, is a story about two young teenagers who are going to be kidnapped by an old demon and killed. They are kidnapped by his boss, Captain Morgan, whom he calls the "monster," and when the killer arrives he takes his own life. The director's screenplay goes on to capture the essence of the premise of the plot: an average young boy is sent to kill a psychopath in the basement of a building, with Morgan and his team of cops and psychiatrists arriving with the news. (Spoiler alert! A big spoiler alert is in play with this project! You should watch the trailer here if you haven't already.)

When the "monster" arrives, he becomes their "slayer" who gets kidnapped and then kills a number of innocent bystanders. (Spoiler alert!) In terms of a sequel to Zodiac Killer, he gets his own villain when he falls in love with Morgan (a vampire in a bad marriage). He also happens to be one of the very first major characters in the franchise to have a new movie. I wouldn't bet against this movie at all. In addition, his villain character is the first character not to have a sequel to Zodiac Killer in just the past year or two.

Let's get back on track. Zodiac Killer is a story about a young girl called Zeta and her teenage brothers, who are planning to leave the world of crime altogether. What they must do in order to do that are two things, and that's an interesting question to ask in one of the biggest genre mash-ups in horror. The first of these two questions has not yet been answered in the synopsis below, and even if it does, it gets pretty confusing when the movie tries to do it right. The synopsis doesn't seem to say that the plot of Zodiac Killer is one way that the movie should succeed. In fact, when Mike Dukakis put the question back, he seemed more and more confused (not to mention not even using a good-faith sense of what could or could not be said), before finally getting around to explaining what that means for the plot in a way that no one would dare to touch:

"Zeta's story is about an old demon whose actions have led her to become a monster."

"In the past, most people who knew Zeta would have been surprised to hear that she, and anyone who knew her, would end up getting kidnapped… But she doesn't."

"What I'm saying is that the characters themselves are kind of the only thing that matters. The main two monsters are inextricably bound up with this new monster and their plans are all about trying to have this new monster get rid of her so they can see her as the one killer who gets it in the first place!"

I don't get that question, but I do get that his second character, the new boss, is not being treated that way. I think Mike Dukakis is trying to keep his focus on this movie as much as possible, with a very specific premise that we know is going to get more sequels to come.

The second and even more important question is why are we so confused over the story so quickly?

Yes, what everyone is expecting from a story about the monster is the usual stuff that we hear about most sequels get when they're being pitched. The monsters. The things they come up with that are all new, are mostly old. And that's just normal. So when Dukakis put the question back into the synopsis, it seemed like he didn't want their audience to realize this until it became clear that Zodiac Killer was not meant to deal with the same set ups and changes and things we've known for decades. So while Dukakis is trying to show viewers that they haven't really seen the movie before, how would your audience have seen the movie if they had never seen the movie before?

For how long? For how large? It's the question. You need to understand that Zodiac Killer is not meant for mass entertainment. It is, rather, meant to be a movie about small children and the "great" monster that does things such as abduct children and kill them and then force the victims to commit acts of evil without remorse?

At least that's what everyone has been told. At times I think that the story itself is so much more entertaining that its audience don't get to see much of it outside of what's being projected. A lot of the movie's "new" stories of kidnapping young children get released so that no one can know about it or understand it, so there's less of a connection to the characters and the stories they carry. So the movie ends when they end up being given a monster who lives up to his or her own reputation as "
