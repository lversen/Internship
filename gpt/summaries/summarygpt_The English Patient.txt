After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The English Patient in a Dream - A Novel About a Boy Who Became a Hero
The picture begins with an awkward looking, middle school middle schooler in a bright orange dress doing nothing but standing by a computer table when a boy calls for his older brother. The kid has gone on vacation and is at the party at the exact same time that the TV station in his life called for a party to celebrate, while the TV station has called to the same movie as well. The two boys share each other's thoughts, each with something they're happy and there is some tension. The parents then go back and are very, very upset when they learn of this and immediately get to school after the first word that they hear from the young man who was in the TV station: "Your brother is in jail for the murders and you killed him so you're innocent, this is my brother's fault and I just didn't care. Sorry, I made everyone watch the movie." It was the first time that any of their other siblings has ever heard about the crime except the "uncle" who was the only one at school at the time.
Before long (the beginning of the fifth act) the kid can be heard having an unhinged laugh in a classroom as the old man has just watched the movie with the kids on the TV, the two boys are laughing too, a second kid is a little late trying to get a book out to his mother for him to read at class and the teacher is giving them the same book as he did the first time they watched the film. Everyone else is completely oblivious. Finally, the teacher starts calling into the office to check in with everyone about the situation. The teacher is not satisfied with nothing and starts yelling something at the two boys, he just doesn't see any action that he thinks of during that very first minute. The young man gives up and is crying out for more. He is still the same old boy and the teacher keeps calling him the same old.
The older boy then goes up to the bathroom to find a big bedroll, what's going on there is that it does come up and look just as tall as the bedroll. The older boy is upset and asks what is going on, the teacher starts saying that his sister wasn't there at the party the night before and there was this big black cloud hanging over her head. "Oh my god that's a very big cloud."
The two boys are shocked that there is this huge cloud hanging over their head when they look at that big dark cloud, the head seems to be still asleep and there is nothing visible in view. The teacher is just like the previous episode and still saying that she's upset of what happened, she tells him to take the curtains off and to start washing them.
The class seems to be at an even mood as the young man has been talking about his brother for about 5 minutes. The teacher tells the young man that there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done to solve this problem and the teacher decides to see the film online so that he can watch it. At last the kids get to school and they learn that the two boys who had the dream that night were taken by two different men and they decided to take their own lives.
The young man does not want to take their lives and the children start to scream for help. The teacher tries talking to the boys as they scream, but can't get any answers. The teachers decide to just go home and wait. They are not there to make anyone's lives better as they don't know their brother and the older boy is being taken by two men.
When the two kids do not hear from each other it is a real shock. They start to scream while watching the movie. The teacher sees the two boys lying there on the couch. They are not breathing now. The teacher says to the children to keep their eyes open for the next 3 or 4 hours, the kids think that just before they turn to cry and go to sleep they came from behind and started running. They get out of their cars as they all run to their cars and there's still nothing.
The last time they watch a movie was in a theater when they were about 6.
