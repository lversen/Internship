After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Tombstone, Tombstone, Tombstone

(The plot follows a group of boys from a school in southern Canada named Tom who are kidnapped and transported back to their homelands in the 1920s by a group of German immigrants. Following a violent encounter, the group decides to return home. They then go to a town near the border to find they need time to get themselves back home. The story is set in a large city called Hesse which is being changed every year by a new town called Pottleau. The town, which is now known as "Venturbe" is the home of Bruce Balfour, a successful architect who is a member of the new village and is a supporter of the new town and its plans to change it. Bruce's father's first assignment was finding money to purchase him a horse. Instead, in an instant, Tony was sent to the village by Bruce's parents to pick up the money. As Bruce was preparing to return to his home life, he was approached by a boy named Don who is being transported to the villages back to his hometown. Bruce's parents arrive at the village, where they discover a man who will turn Bruce into an automaton, and they begin to chase after him.

Peter Quill, in the original screenplay, wrote several of the short stories based on the movie and his short story of the same name can be found here. A lot of the character's names in the original film are taken from comic strips which have been published by Marvel and are based on the name of the writer. Also a lot of other characters (mostly villains) have been included in several of the short stories as well as in several stories featuring them in real life. There are other similarities between what the characters in the film were and what the novel is to some of the original movie characters.

The plot also goes beyond just a group of boys being abducted and sent back to their homelands. It is an all male story and it contains only some story that is more important than the other story. The movie features the young Tom and Henry while Tom is a teenager. This story is set around the time at the age of 15 when Bruce is still young. This new story is also set during WWII, when German forces were forced to surrender in Normandy. With the Allied forces under their command, Peter Quill starts the movie and changes the timeline of the event from 1915 to 1947. Tom and Henry go to Normandy with their father to rescue Tommy and save their village. He then proceeds to a fight with the local guards at the entrance of the village where Tommy suffers one of the most painful injuries. Tommy and Peter finally get their vengeance in the movie during the battle in the woods. The second part of the story begins when Peter and Tommy are transported back to Ville-Univertain where they meet a lot of people. These guys meet with Mr. and Mrs. Toussaint of the Goulburn Farm for a picnic. This is a place that the town is being created as a location for the town to establish an industrial industry. The location allows the town to have the same feeling as Paris.


A major piece of action, the role played by the young Tom's father, is that from the beginning he has to work alongside them to save his family. His job takes a lot of work in the movie and it also shows in the novel. The boys at a school in the village go back to Tom's homelands with the help of a group of boys who are searching for a new homelance to be created in the town. Tom's father was kidnapped and that night, he goes to an abandoned shopping mall in the town to find a new homelance that won't be built until he dies. He takes his new homelance to a young family in a very unusual way, he starts to feel different about himself from when he was a young boy and as a result he is moved by the experience. However, he struggles with the emotions and doesn't want to go to the same place over and over again due to the way his past is being manipulated. When he finally goes there, he has to deal with the emotions of the time and the new homelance. He and the group of boys try to stop the new homelance but they get caught up in the situation and are forced to get rid of him as well as his other brothers and sisters for the sake of saving Tommy and the village and all the people in the town.


This story is told in a very traditional way that doesn't focus on a group of boys fighting each other for their own goals in order to take over Ville-Univertain and save the town. There are also some scenes involving the town's past that will take some time to do, but this movie is intended
