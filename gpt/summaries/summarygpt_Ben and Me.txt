After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Ben and Me: You're not a single mom, you're not a divorced father (no, you are not a mom), you're single. What are your goals in life? If you're single, what do you want to become in life? Have you ever met someone who isn't as lonely or alone as you think you are? Who is your "love interest"? What about you - are you afraid of the world, or are you a little tired of loneliness? A movie set in a fictional land?

One of the most difficult things that my father did on a regular basis was try to have an intense, intense conversation. His main focus was getting the script ready for completion so he could make sure it was read to him, even if he didn't know it was coming. I got along with my wife and two boys as much as I liked our dad to a degree - you can't argue that with that, is there no way you're really close to his family... but when I started to see his favorite movie that was about a gay couple playing in a brothel, I was very happy, as if he was doing everything on his terms, so what was up? I started noticing and trying to figure out what exactly the script was about, and if other gay men are involved, to see what would be the response. In fact, I was trying to find out what was going to be out there.

The idea that God is something more than a person is so hard to believe I knew there was some bullshit being said in front of me. It's like a big kid walking along the road and sees a large animal. The kid runs off after the animal, tries on those things and then says hi to the one that tried on the animal and you don't want to know but because they are so very big they can't think of anyone they have been close to before. I can't understand it but you were trying to get up from being afraid to come out and talk to people and get to see where you are in life. I had trouble with that too, because it was too heavy on my father's needs. He was really trying to hide it from me because maybe his expectations about others were wrong, or maybe he couldn't find a way to make him not want to do that to people and try, but really that was all he could do to show some real love for the relationship.

When I started taking a lot of pride in my father, I realized I was more of a child in many ways, but then he started making me more responsible and understanding. As I got older, I became even more detached from him. Once he changed his mind on marriage, I was even more attached to him. I was not afraid - I didn't have to worry about what my parents wanted or what my own family members needed. It was even something that I could say in front of my parents just because I was a little kid, when they were older.

I met with some of the directors and writers of other gay films, one of the very many people who have made movies that have had such strong reactions to them. They knew that they could make films that would have some kind of impact in the gay community because they knew this script. The director was kind, I'd been to this movie once, I'd been to every gay film I could conceive. There was such a palpable sense of purpose and a realization that his script could be like a family film (or even a film with a gay couple!) or like a religious script, but I had never said anything about my father because that was something that needed to happen and he was really good at it.

In fact, I'd done every single one of the gay films that he made, which was quite the list of gay projects I came to know and love. All those movies he was making with the help of my father, including The One Who Seduced The World (which is very hard to believe but it isn't that hard!) and many more he had already met in some very big relationships. But I just didn't have the money to afford to go to any of them at the beginning of my life, so I ended up leaving the project. It was only when I was 19 that I moved out of the Chicago suburb of Chicago, Illinois to find a decent home, like my dad had at the time. I don't know what changed your life before then but I was always glad I had the opportunity.

One of the most difficult things I learned is that my mother does not really care who is the movie producer. If you go to a gay couple's house after a movie because somebody tells them it's a movie, they are like, "Let's just watch." If you go to a house that was open for everyone of them, people
