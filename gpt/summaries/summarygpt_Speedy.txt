After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Speedy with a few extra moments. One of the few moments I think is good, but, hey… It's like in 'Paranormal Activity.' Just because I don't know when it ends doesn't mean it won't be fun.


Mood:

"I find this movie entertaining. It had a lot of fun. The other movies you'll hear now that I watched may feel like a bit more."

Dwight:

"I don't see how the plot was handled because it wasn't done for a few reasons. It wasn't a lot of fun to watch. It is interesting to see if you get the gist of the movie."

Mood:

"I watched a lot of Dark and the First Inaugural in the past year, and I noticed some things that were missing. I want to see why the movie takes such a long time, as it has such a good pacing."

Rating:

"For my tastes this movie is not for everyone."
