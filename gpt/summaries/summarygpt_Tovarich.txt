After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Tovarich's "A Game That Never Had a Fight": In the early 1980s, the CIA wanted a new fighter to be armed, and was interested in buying a helicopter. In March of 1985, President Reagan announced that he was authorizing $500 million to purchase a new fighter.

From 1983 on, the United States sent a large quantity of military equipment to Yugoslavia to build the next generation of American bombers. Some of the most valuable military equipment was on a Yugoslav aircraft carrier. The U.S. was then able to obtain the second generation of Yugoslav fighter planes based on some of the "Fitzel" fighter planes, known as the Tuzovids. The first American fighter to be flown by Yugoslavia since it was founded in the Soviet-era capital of Dien Bien Phu in 1961 flew from San Diego to Moscow on July 24, 1972, according to the U.S. Air Force. That was a long time.

By mid-May 1979, Reagan announced that his plan to invade Bosnia and Herzegovina would be "a coup attempt against the government of the United States, in the name of American nationalism and against America's democratic values".

In 1984, Reagan was elected president again. This time, he took office as new president and brought with him a massive war that had lasted three years, and that was a far bigger military and diplomatic problem, then still being the biggest in history.

In 1989, it became more complicated. The war began with the bombing of Yugoslavia – in response to the atrocities happening in Bosnia under the name "Croatia", which was officially "the Serb Republic of Kosovo".

Croatia eventually returned to independence, when the government of President Tito V was toppled.

By January 1990, Yugoslavia became Yugoslavia, and soon after, there was a real war raging between the Serbs and Serbs. One week into the war, in a very cold and brutal way, the Serbs captured half the city of Izmir as they were marching towards Tuzovsk.

In retaliation, the Albanian government called the United Nations. It was a UN Security Council resolution (yes, the UN is still in place) which asked for an extension of U.S.-Croatian relations. Yugoslavia joined the treaty only after it was dissolved.

By the end of 1991, no matter how many planes were flying in Bosnia, the Serbs still had a significant military and diplomatic problem, and were also trying to get rid of the British troops that had been there by the beginning of 1992. They were getting rid of the British troops by the end of 1994 when the Yugoslav Union called the G-8 to discuss peacekeeping there.

As the British war against Croatia grew, so did the Serbs' military and their diplomatic tensions and anger. The Yugoslavian war effort got so bad, that the UN Security Council suspended it in 2003. It also suspended the G-10, which it decided to abandon in 2004. This meant that it was very difficult for the British military in Albania and Yugoslavia to get the rights of the Albanians back to their former independence.

Croatia would try to take full control of the country until 1998 before the G-20 meeting in Durban in August 1998, and then continue the current crisis until the end of a new transitional government in July 2000.

After a number of events, there's evidence that the United States was to try to get the war going if Yugoslavia took over. There were already signs pointing to the possibility that if the war goes on, the Americans could try to create chaos by bombing another country and the Americans could use the G-15 as a tool of American military and diplomatic influence.

It is in this connection that we should mention the "Fitzel" planes and Tuzovids. Many other military instruments were also used by the United States, including what we call the F-35 (the one that went off the flight deck at Pearl Harbor in 1966, and in 1973 crashed into the USS John McCain). More about this and the different versions of this "Fitzel" aircraft as well as others like them in an upcoming book.

In an attempt to draw attention to both of these aircraft on this blog, I'm going to be covering a number of different military and diplomatic aspects of the same aircraft. The last time we covered Tuzovids was in 2007 and the first time I've ever covered them in an article was back in 2001 when they were considered for the very best aircraft to fight the U.S., and we're not getting the best of them today. If you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the stuff you'll be getting, you can check out my original article on the F-35 on this website.
