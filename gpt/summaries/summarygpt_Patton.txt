After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Patton, the charismatic New York attorney of the 20th century, and his law firm's own self-destructive, nihilistic boss.

On October 7th the following day the Hollywood Reporter and The Hollywood Reporter:

Patton had been a big part of so many successful counter films including this documentary called The Hollywood Way, which chronicles how his firm's business acumen, success, and legacy has shaped The Hateful Eight's iconic film. There's even a poster for it over at The Film Critics Association's website. "Patton is a kind of hero," says Jim Ritchie, who directed The Hateful Eight and The Wicker Man. "He's fearless because he's the only guy who can take on a life without feeling too proud and ashamed about how things used to be. And if the next one doesn't quite hold up then Patton is going to just be a little more than that. A person of that kind does. He has a wonderful inner self and a truly amazing sense of humor that comes from him."

The Hateful Eight: The Return of King Louis XIV arrives in theaters on February 6th, 2017.
