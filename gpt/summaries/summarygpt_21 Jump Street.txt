After this input give a synopsis of this movie: 21 Jump Street is an action-heavy, action-packed thriller that takes place in Manhattan, Manhattan, and, hopefully, over time. In the last year, this movie scored a C-minus from critics. Even its director, Tom Hardy, had no problem making a good point here that this movie's pacing and setting were not a fluke in recent years, as the action in the movie's opening scene was very good (see the video below for a close-up of the opening scene, if you dare). The main characters of the film are, so far, not the only ones suffering in this movie – not even Ben Affleck, who has played a very different character in the franchise since the first one began filming. The character development is pretty similar to Blade Runner, with Ben Affleck being a big help for his chemistry with director Ridley Scott as well as his acting talent and strong supporting performances. The cinematography is really good, and there is no feeling of speed at all in this movie, so let's look at what we'll see in our next three minutes.

19. D.F. Skinner's Last Stand – Director, Writer/Directors, Cinematographer/Vinegar

It feels that this movie is basically the opposite of this. Instead, the director of this movie plays Dr. Skinner. He was a big part of the original film's main conflict, and he ended up being the one who brought the movie down from that level of despair when it comes to his job. He's very good in directing, and the fact that he is a writer and director brings him closer to those in the original movie, particularly when he makes references to the first two films, such as when the plot of D.F. Skinner's last stand in a series of crime drama is about being bullied out of his home by an angry and angry psychopath.

18. The Incredible Hulk vs. The Incredible Hulk + The Incredible Hulk 2 – Director, Producer/Director, Cinematographer/Director

As always, this film is great for getting its head out of your throat. The Director and Cinematographer of the movie did not only bring D.F. Skinner's fight and the conflict to a life-and-death-for the audience at large, but their relationship between the two had a lot in common – both had a huge impact on the plot of this movie and even in the script at the beginning of this movie, which I thought was a great move to make. This is exactly what audiences are looking forward to to, and should be very easy to follow for anyone.

17. The Last of the Giants – Director, Producer, Director

Like The Last of the Giants, The Last of the Giants 2 is in many ways different than the original. There are no main character's heads, but only their heads. They are rather a bit different to the original film, as they are much more focused on the story and world in the original film, whereas The Last of the Giants 2 is much more about getting a good sense of character and setting from the director through to the main characters, and then ultimately through the actors to help them accomplish their mission in some way. The movie takes place in a time that is different both from that in The Im, which had more in common with the time that this movie takes place during the IM's prime (see the video below of The Last of the Giants 1st season preview), and is also far less about the main character's relationships with the characters – for example, in this film, it takes place much later than the beginning of the IM's prime – and also is far more centered around the fight scenes of the IM. In some ways, this is also where the two main storylines in this movie come together – it is an IM where the characters' conflicts and struggles as a group go hand in hand, but also where The Last of the Giants 3 goes hand in hand with its two main characters. And what makes it all the more compelling, is that while The Last of the Giants 2 does a great job at telling its story in a fast paced, action-packed way and taking care to give viewers a better sense of what's happening on the big screen.

15. Man of Steel III & Four-Bag – Director, Writer/Director

Like it or not, The Last of the Giants 2 was a big hit on the internet. One of the most famous characters in this movie, The Last of the Giants 3 was released two weeks before, and this is a very important factor in our opinion, because the first three of the films in The Last of the Giants were also widely praised for this. They were actually filmed around the same time, so it would have been a perfect time for The Last
