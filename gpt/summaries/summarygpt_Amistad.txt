After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Amistad, the son of a wealthy lawyer. He travels through the deserts of the world, finding many new things to find in his search for hope. Although he always wanted to find something, there was much, much more he only found. The world around him has changed since the day he left school to seek out life with a purpose and meaning. While his mission to find out if the world is ever where he dreamed never came to pass, he has been drawn into this universe so far that he no longer knows if he is free or not. Through his experiences he has begun to realize that his true future is always somewhere far away. With his friends he finally has the chance to be himself. For Amistad, he hopes that someday, the world can be like his past life no matter, but if it is anything other, it always belongs in the past. There are many mysteries and dangers that this book exposes, both from a family and a community, but also each one of Amistad's main actions at this age.

Wyong Tung's stories are filled with a very unique, realistic look at the life and times of a world without human connection. Each story focuses upon a different character and provides a good feeling to a large story. With the character interactions, action and stories in general, the reader is exposed to many more stories to read, so they can make better decisions later on.

Wyong Tung's stories have also been influenced by the story of Amistad, his friends, and their journey to becoming free. Through his struggles, success, freedom, and eventually, happiness and love, he finds himself in relationships around his world, which is completely new. His journey has taught him countless new things and will allow him to continue to grow through other people's lives. As he begins to find his life he feels a lot more comfortable and even closer with other people, but also has a bit more freedom in his own way. The book focuses on Amistad and his journey and shows a good balance between friendship and work, friendship is a common denominator within friendship.

A story that contains a wide range of themes, but does a good job of presenting a fair and authentic story, we can see both sides of Amistad's story very well. With the story being about life that is outside of his home planet, we have to understand what happens from Amistad's point of view, and what will happen to the world around him after Amistat. It does more to reveal how Amistat can be the only person that gets through and ends our lives (and thus will have lasting effects on how we live in our homes).

The novel is about Amistad's story, but also a large, and complex one. The story is so detailed and complicated it is even a little scary, but it also goes beyond Amistat's story, as it takes Amistad deep into his own personal arc on the internet. We find Amistad going through similar and different stages, with stories that are simply fantastic, and the story goes on so long it makes us realize that a story that isn't always true (the good and the evil, for example) can still be true. Amistat is not a typical American movie villain, but a normal American kid with so much drama and plot and a wide range of character. His world is filled with interesting characters, and a story takes that to the extreme through Amistat's actions.

These stories do make us notice a little bit about how the world of life works in this world (and sometimes even on Amistat's planets too, but you've probably seen it before where life was quite different from the "real world" at one time or another). If the characters do what works for them (i.e. live up to their potential, feel like they are worthy of our love, and accept the changes in our world, or not) then they can still be a good protagonist in their own right. If we have any sort of sense of what this world looks like when we are outside it, then Amistat is the world we really want to live inside.

With the world wide reading community, we have a much better chance of finding out what other people are doing in a different way in the world. The only questions that can be asked is this: "How do they succeed in achieving their ambitions?" or is this a sign that one of our characters can be the one that they want to become? Either way, many of the stories that have been published at the moment and given our feedback have made us realize more about Amistat.

In short, what Amistat is really is a lot different from the other characters and more than the two, his story is also a story of
