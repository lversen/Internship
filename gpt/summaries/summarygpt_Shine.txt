After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Shine

(A.N.): The movie starts at about the time this is all happening

(C:N.): A.N., as he was a teacher and friend who had a heart attack

(A.N.): This would have included a similar film in the same year. He wanted to try his first movie, but his mind was not up to it because of his fear of people not knowing his name

A.N.: The movie takes place in the same year as his birthday (January). It's not clear that Shine is that familiar with the movie, as "My name is Eun-Ra, we're from the future" doesn't explain this fact in much detail other than saying it's a movie that only seems like it has a lot of detail. At times, it seems like there's a lot to know, but most of the things are covered up by the book

A.N.: In the background is the person that is talking to him.

(A.N.): This is where they ask him a number of questions. The first one that gets asked will be his name and his current job on the show.

(C:N.): So how does it feel? He is still feeling great. Now that we understand his past life for all these years, he really knows what happened to his life. He asks very specific questions that will not be answered by a few movie references, but a lot of people remember and can identify with him. The movie gives us all this sense of "I know his past and I'm ready for him to remember." As the characters remember and say to each other, "This is like me…I know everything this person is going through, but they know that everything that he is about, this is my past." And that's always been one aspect of the movie, just like you can see in the characters so clearly

A.N.: This is about a story line.

(A.N.): And he needs to go to the future in order to get it back. So in a way, there will be three parts to this movie that are pretty important. It makes the movie seem like it's going to be his childhood or a lifetime of his life.

A.N.: So he knows that everything is there with him.

(C:N.): There are many characters that will be in this movie that are pretty obvious until just later on in the movie that he does know.

A.N.: So that's when he can finally make contact again with the guy he met at the end of the movie.

A.N.: And it's pretty important that he knows this guy. And in the movie when he tells that story, it becomes obvious what he can do to get away from it entirely. It can be like this: I can take him to the future of the show to live my life.

(A.N.: Another name for this movie that is important in its scope is "Re-Flashback" which is another famous name for the movie)

A.N.: So by being "re-flashback" one has a different sense of being. And this brings home some of the themes the movie offers. In the book "Re-Flashback" there is a huge conflict between these two movies. The book tells the story of the end of Re-Flashback and they only do one thing in the movie to explain why Re-Flashback is better.

(A.N.: He is trying to save his dad, so I can't really say that a lot, but it is not so great)

(C:N.): But there are multiple characters who end up saving him (re-flashbacks are sometimes called flashbacks and they are usually shown in a scene and they are usually showing up as separate scenes, like a scene in a movie), but when they do they just disappear or reappear. And like a flashback was shown before, in the book there are several scenes of these characters that are only shown in a different scene. Those are never shown in the movie and that was one of the issues in this movie. So it was definitely a big issue.

A.N.: But because of his past, you know how important he is now.

(A.N.: We see that he is very well connected.)

(C:N.): So his relationship with the guy he met, even if a little different than the story will help us to understand and like, understand, understand that he needs to become a person closer to him, that he will become a person to give to his father, and he then will become a more personable person.

A.N.: Another important element of the story as explained by
