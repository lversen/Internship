After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Batman, Brave New World, Robin, Robin Returns, The Flash, Supergirl, Aquaman, Zero Day, Captain America: Civil War, Suicide Squad, and Suicide Squad 2! I could also add that my opinion is that most of the actors in this movie fit pretty well, in one way or another... and they are all pretty awesome.

They are not the movies I would have seen in my lifetime. At least not for an average adult audience or those of us who would consider ourselves "enthusiasts", but for one of the biggest, most iconic movies of the 70's.

If you are in this "big 4" and would like to see it on DVD and Blu-ray, but your budget is too big, get in touch with us by E-mail! I'd also love to hear from you!
