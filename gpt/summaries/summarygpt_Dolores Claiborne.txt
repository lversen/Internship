After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Dolores Claiborne's original film The Shining, where she plays an orphan, is one of those movies, and I think the biggest change was in the sound. I think its so dark and beautiful, and so humanistic. And I think it's also the same, but then you hear The Shining's own voice, because everyone was in the same room and I was in that room. And you know, we played the first scene for the entire movie, and then my daughter came over. And I always thought it was incredible that in the first scene that she was in there — I mean I remember looking out of the window at the moonlight and suddenly I was watching this beautiful woman come to life, and then she's at us.

Parks and Recreation: It seems like there's a lot going on in this adaptation, is there?

Barrett (Scott Hance): Well, I think there was a lot going on and I was doing a little sketch called Rave to the Slaughter and then I took over writing as I'd been doing for a while and the director, Sam Baker, came over and he played the part of Jack Nicholson and he's going to be pretty cool to me. I feel like he's been playing with some of this beautiful, but kind of weird, humanistic, dark, heart-shaped characters. We also brought in actors who are just really good at taking on this weird and different story and we didn't have to work a lot on The Shining and it really turned out to be a wonderful film.

Parks and Recreation: This was really a real treat, being in and out of the same building as a whole family.

Barrett (Scott Hance): Yes, it was really an experience that we wouldn't have expected for the whole cast, and I really enjoyed the movie because this is a story where there are a lot of people who are very cool and I can't find a really strong character to play that kind of character and that kind of emotional side. And it's kind of interesting in the fact that not a lot of people were really talking about that sort of role, you'd be talking about the way that your characters were treated in the comics. And I thought that we really made a really good movie. I think I felt very lucky to be writing it and it was actually a really well liked movie. But then at the end, you're reading about it, and you're thinking, "Oh! How much does it cost?" It was not great. We were not expecting the movies to sell so well. But we did see some reviews and everybody was really talking about how much of the money was spent on this particular version and how much was spent on it and how much of that had just been spent on the version in which we were writing. So those reviews didn't really give a lot of credit to it at all. And at least one in particular we saw an editorial review of, "I hate to say it but there's another two or three more movies we should do in 2018." But at the end, we were right there with it and we went, "Ohhh, now that is what we're doing."

Parks and Recreation: Have you had access to any movies about the women in The Darksiders that you've written about previously?

Barrett (Scott Hance): That's been my dream movie since day one of my first job as a screenwriter. I've read plenty of The Darkside as a kid as well, and I've been doing a bit of doing the old '62 Batman in those movies. And I think I got some great friends in the '55's to contribute to that. And I went to a few of these movies and my partner, my brother-in-law, and a friend of mine, he asked me to do the character-writing for the two movies that we were doing. I don't really remember anything really, and honestly we were talking about it, like, no it hadn't been done. But because I kind of came to realize that as early as the '30s and it'd never been done, I kind of was getting excited and said, "Look, we can do this because I'm a writer and want to do a superhero movie, but we want to do a non-hero superhero movie." And so we've already done a number of things, for instance the film was being written, I think, that I'm going to have to do, and this movie was written, the screenplay we made for that is actually one of those two movies. That was a little rough on me, and then you talk to a writer that was in there, and your job is sort of a little different now and I'm getting excited to do that movie.
