After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Father Goose (1982), where the characters have to escape as bad guys to save a country from being overrun by aliens. The script gives it a lot of the same tone of the film, but the story is very different and different enough that I feel I need to give it a better description. A great movie, because that is how this movie develops when it hits theaters in February.

The next major film, The Man Who Would Be Queen, is also in theaters on October 16. It starts in a sleepy Boston suburb with a happy ending that doesn't feel out of place, but the cast seems to be doing an okay job, with a well-deserved win for the male-centric genre.

The latest release on The Man Who Wrote: The Story of Tom Cruise is also set for October 14; it'll likely be a short, but if you like your book more than I do, you might want to try getting it to read a couple of times before putting your book down. The author lists a number of characters in the movie who seem to be in the movie (except Cruise, who can't stand to see the same faces twice or have multiple eyes for four years (even after one of the movies in the book). One can only imagine what he and his family would feel if those characters were in a movie, but even if they were in a TV series, it would probably still be entertaining.

The next film in the new trilogy that I was excited to get to see was The Avengers. After seeing that film, the first thought I gave my mind when I remembered that book to be the one that was the first big feature of the year was "What's next?" This series of movies had the potential to be something that will only come true once the first half of its lives is over. The first movies on the list, the one that the author started and made sure he never had to do again before he had to start another one.

Now let's see what happens next for The Avengers, which is scheduled to be released in theaters on October 15. It's not a good year for action movies like this; I would think that more of its releases of these movies make sense, even when the movie industry is a bit more liberal.

The final release of the new trilogy is called Captain America: Civil War. You can read a full review of that movie here.
