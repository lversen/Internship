After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Trainspotting. A group of boys meet in school and attempt to figure out what's wrong with the world around them. They find themselves thrown into a chaotic, post-apocalyptic world where a new age is the only way out of its violent death. A series of apocalyptic train accidents take place every other week and with it all the humans who've lost their friends make their transition to the outside world. As for the kids, the only hope left is getting a decent job, but that doesn't mean any of them are about to take that step. A young gang of teenagers are caught up in a horrific train accident, each of which becomes a tragic mess as each year they progress into adulthood and become the adults around them. One of the children, named Yolando Deja de los Reyes (played by Carlos Valdez), is diagnosed with PTSD, has PTSD symptoms and becomes one of many kids afflicted with the virus. The rest of the children, who have been trapped in abandoned buildings, get out and are treated by the authorities. Their journey of redemption begins in the woods, but before they can see and hear the ending of Trainspotting, the virus and its perpetrators begin an apocalyptic battle for their lives. The stakes will be high for the entire movie, with the fate of mankind in particular impacting how it handles its characters. It is important to note that the film is going to be the last time the government makes its characters feel safe. The government actually allows these characters a limited number of jobs over time and the kids are in a difficult position to return to. The final three members of the cast are also going to lose most of their abilities and most of their friends, including their best friend, her friend, and their favorite childhood friend, her ex-husband, and, most importantly, the people who were once friends to them. Even the adults who were once classmates at school, still felt they were still at an age where things had to grow out of context. So while the characters have a lot of growth potential that will be more than enough for the majority of the movie to hold its audience in high spirits and continue to appeal to more and more young people it does not address what their roles as teenagers in this world have in common. The film also has some really uncomfortable sequences in which these young adults are forced to work harder to get by. It is very disturbing and yet again this movie doesn't tackle it with enough love and care. These characters are given only one or two roles at this point and are forced to put themselves in different roles to work the job and maintain the same level of social status with the people they are meant to represent. There are moments where the characters end up getting into heated arguments just because of their backgrounds and they end up in different parts of the world. The film even shows them in an uncomfortable position when asked into the living room where they are treated as potential enemies, a situation which many of the characters were forced to make extremely vulnerable in order to avoid being put out of touch with their lives by a major character. Overall it is not a great movie if you consider how poorly the other half of movies do by their standards. Hopefully everyone finds that movie interesting and appreciated.
