After this input give a synopsis of this movie: GoldenEye: BFG, which features a group of five-six young men who try to break into an alley of teenagers with some magic that sends them to the same town as a group of two other teenagers. When the group enters this alley, we're told that they were there for a job offer, which is an attempt to kidnap a girl after they fail to have any other information. As usual their attempts are unsuccessful, though at the end of the film everyone seems to be very surprised that it's no longer going to work out. This was a film that didn't give us the same sense of a good movie the first time around, but one that did and that has always been a welcome change as the genre gains ground.
