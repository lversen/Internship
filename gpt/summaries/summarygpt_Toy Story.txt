After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Toy Story 2, Tumblrs, the movie. The synopsis says that it's gonna be fun and pretty. If you don't mind it, or think the synopsis wasn't enough, here are some of the important things, that you should know at this time:

The Story

Before we dive in, our main storyline takes place in Japan for the first few days of the Toy Story film's run. I went in to the movie at Tokyo Toy Show.

It is basically your standard animation, but there are a few changes to it that have a huge impact.

I've mentioned the transformation time in this section before. This change allows our hero the freedom to create new transformations, and make himself into all sorts of different poses. The animation gives an even more beautiful illustration.

The movie ends with a new animation, which I will describe below.

The Animation

The first scene of the movie is pretty cool.

There is also a big scene between Tuma and Shizuru, and they get to meet and have a little chat about how their lives have changed for each other. I like that they talked about how much their lives have changed for each other, a little bit. I've already seen the anime, but it's the right stuff to mention in a couple people's reactions. When it ended I would always love to watch this movie again, but now that I'm out of Japan I'm really ready to start watching it again.

The Story

As we move into Toy Story, each character gets new adventures and new moves along with their story, which is important in this movie.

For one and only characters of this film, we get a short segment that takes you to a side of the world they're on which is where they came from (Kara's Village and the Village of Mice and Men). These characters aren't as great as the original monsters, and their own adventures have the same feeling. They all have a special role in the adventure. For all characters the main character is a boss and has a whole story, and the main character is the antagonist.

There are also changes involving animals.

For one outcast animal is Mii, which has to fend for itself after getting chased by one of its own. This is a change that I feel will leave many people unsatisfied.

The Other Stuff

As I mentioned before, there are a dozen other things that change that character every time they pass that side of the story, which makes this movie quite challenging.

When you look at something, there is probably more that changes than the original movie. It's possible that there isn't a ton to learn from this movie, but still.

There are a couple changes to things. I don't think there was room to learn something from this movie. It is just like watching the real life story of the characters from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean before it, not the fictional worlds. You can see different elements in the story while watching the movie, but that's all you can do.

It is definitely not worth a hard look at, to see the changes of a character. This movie will keep you entertained for months and months. Even the ones that are already seen. I think this movie will stand as one of the worst, as shown here during the story section. It's a shame since there are so many different characters in this movie to share, but I think every single character has become an important part of the story.

It's just a shame. This movie didn't have any good parts as long as it lasted, but this movie will have fun too.

So let me put it into words, what is a good movie with a great story?

How to Watch: The Toy Story 1 and 2 Movie

The first part of this section does what it's intended to do: A very thorough explanation of the anime. It has many important tips and things on different things, things that even anime should be aware of, things that would have been lost in a bad book.

The second part of this section is basically the one where the anime comes from, that is, how the main character goes about his life, how the story is told and how this movie tells it in an important sense. To this point the series has spent many long stretches developing their own world, and I really like how this movie allows them to take the opportunity of seeing this world, to create beautiful experiences and create an environment with their own sense of adventure, just by going outside in their own world. This movie is about a young and cute boy that's trying to escape from the past.

The Anime, with the anime's other parts I have been talking about, are going to be a very different
