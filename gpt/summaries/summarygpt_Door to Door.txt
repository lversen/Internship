Robert Carlyle (aka "Eclipse Angel" of "Halo"), the writer and executive producer of "The End With Chris Pratt," is playing an alter-ego within The Avengers who is introduced to a new generation as their own villain. Upon being found out, Helmut Zemo, an evil villain from the past, sets out to kill him, leading to a fight between Hawkeye and Zemo. Helmut and Hawkeye defeat the alter-ego and defeat the evil leader of The Avengers, Thor. Meanwhile, Hawkeye and the Avengers are at odds, but not before they kill Thor, who defeats X-Men in the end and forces Hawkeye's way back to the present world after his final battle with Cyclops. Helmut is finally free to return to his former life and he meets with X-Force's leader, former Scarlet Witch, during an intermission at the Citadel in London; Helmut is shocked to learn that Logan's "death", as she calls him, was his. The next day, he and Logan meet up with X-Force and Cyclops in New York City on their journey, and while in New York Logan meets with Hawkeye, in a car, which he later calls Zemo. The two meet at Logan's old friend's house to spend time together.

In issue #26, a new "hero" arrives in the form of Quicksilver who attempts to stop the Avengers and their "destruction", but has his "heroic powers" stopped by Zemo. Upon reaching his "hero" he is taken into custody by the "Hero Team"- the Avengers who has assembled a new body, the Quinjet.[13] Unfortunately the team's only one of its own member, a young and very talented teenager named "Tiffany" (also known as "Spider-Woman's" "Buddy"), will have to rely on an old comrade like Thor to save him from being captured by an uninvited team of Avengers, and he is left stranded in a desert landscape until a former friend of his, a soldier named "Buddha" (also known as "The Spider") appears to help him. Tiffany later reunites with Hawkeye and his team, but finds Quicksilver who will take her down quickly. The two then stop on a road, but the young teen is found and defeated by "the Avengers" as the other team members try and stop the boy's "destruction".

The duo then head for the planet Cybertron where they arrive at "The City," and Quicksilver soon becomes the new leader of the team as the Avengers and his new team confront a horde of "Misfits" led by Thanos. However the young teen becomes frustrated by Hawkeye's plans to start World War II with Iron Man (the only "hero" to have appeared since he first appeared in "Fantastic Four" #9 for the first time). He is now called to the new world "The World of Tomorrow," named "The World of Freedom" and the team is assigned to fight the super-villains and try to stop them. As the battle becomes raging, a team of heroes arrives to help. Hawkeye, being Iron Man himself, has to turn to Thor and give a message to Thanos: "You see the power he created, and your dreams come true. Now give it to me."

As Hawkeye and his team arrive on an unknown planet they are captured by the "Evil Soldiers,"
