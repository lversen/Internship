After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Rocky Balboa (1976), The Big Lebowski (1973), and Jack Reacher (1990). In addition to this, any "movie score" has to feature the "Baldwin Family" theme sung by John Wayne, who is part of a crew that takes on a variety of roles, from a young boy working in a bar to the old man with his dad's business, the "Baldwin Family" actor. Finally, while there are only two scenes in the movie which were ever played in theatres, which was chosen as the main highlight of the entire screening, I must mention the ending to this series wherein El Capitan decides to kill his father and the rest of his family, for a small price. I would recommend it. The film scores for Rocky Balboa are as follows:

Baldwin Family

Jack Reacher

The Big Little Lies

The Big Lebowski

The Big Break
