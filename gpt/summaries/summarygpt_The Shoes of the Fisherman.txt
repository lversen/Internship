After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Shoes of the Fisherman, John Malkovich's remake of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, 2001 (2002). It follows the adventures of "Penny's Shoes" (Mark and the Whale), an Australian couple who spend their first six months on a raft to South America, where they find themselves "given an almost totally unspeakably complex but remarkably similar" existence.

10. "The Day After Tomorrow" (1998)

Starz's "The Day After Tomorrow" is one of only two Disney properties to feature a feature based on the 1960s classic. That movie's cast were: Jennifer Lawrence (The Martian), Michael Ian Black, J.K. Simmons, Richard E. Lassiter, and Steve Carell ("Starman, Part II"). With no real action plot at stake in its opening, "The Day After Tomorrow" is an instant classic because everyone (or at least the characters) reacts right to the camera. Despite the "Day After Tomorrow" opening, the plot has had a very good start and is now in production. - Mark Gentry (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope: The Return of the Jedi)

9. "The Princess and the Frog" (2011)

Star Wars is about to begin filming its remake of A Princess and the Frog: A Star Wars Story, featuring a whole new set of characters, including some of the most amazing looking pirates in the history of video games. It's not to say the Star Wars film won't be more interesting to fans, as many films released from time to time take inspiration from the Star Wars universe during its development. But "The Princess and the Frog" definitely has a different feeling and story to it than a simpler story that's all about the princess. I wouldn't recommend that you put those two together when you're thinking about playing this movie... but if this is your first time playing that movie... make sure you pick up the original. - Mark Gentry (Star Wars Episode V:A New Hope: The Return of the Jedi)

8. "A Man in Black: The First and Last Act" (1994)

The last time that the film featured only an opening scene or two, The Day After Tomorrow was shot in 1995. Well, in this case, instead of focusing on the first two chapters and focusing on some scenes of "A Man in Black: The First and Last Act," the movie shows up during the "Rise of the Red Storm," or, in other words, the one and only scene in The Day after Tomorrow. In fact, The Day after Tomorrow is the only one of its kind. As a result, you may have forgotten "A Man in Black: The First and Last Act" on a second time you played. The first, a short "Bitter Hour," saw an unexpected conclusion to a series of events which the film would never have followed. In this part of the film, John is kidnapped and taken from on high, just as this happens! The story is told in the second act, where John is sent to learn the name of the "master," a woman who believes that John is the mother of John's son. If you're a fan of this movie, you're likely well aware of the fact that that part of the story is completely unnecessary, including how it would have been avoided if it had been a prologue in the main storyline. In a story, the first 10 acts show the characters interacting with one another and trying to solve a complex mystery. - Michael Stuhlbarg

7. "In My Head, And One By One" (1987)

What the heck do you know about Star Wars? Well, this movie and the sequel to "In My Head, And One By One" really shouldn't. The movie is a sequel to the 1987 movie "The Force Strikes Back," in which it tries to be different. In this section, we learn one thing (along with an interesting fact): one of the major characters in the 1980s movie "In My Head" is a boy whom you didn't know existed by the end of that film. He's a beautiful young boy named Bob Traviss who's living in the same city after he's killed a bunch of bullies. He's in a lot of trouble but doesn't end up getting his own fortune. There's a few moments where he's trapped in one tiny space, where if he tries to make an effort (like "He's
