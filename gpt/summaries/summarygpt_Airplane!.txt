After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Airplane! When an army of ants is about to march on Earth, the only problem is they've never been to space. When all of the ants do is march down some weird pathway through space, the one person they can trust is a man. When the ants encounter Earth, the only person they can trust is a man. When The Road To Armageddon begins, these ants have to find the key to a secret space station. One person may be a scientist or a pilot. And the second person may be the world's only known scientist, a genius. Now each of them, in their own way, might become a man! An episode was released before The Road To Armageddon, and it did not feature a man or a man's wife. Instead, it focused on two people living in an alien planet that resembles their own home: the man-ship that you are with, and the alien spaceship you are visiting. However, they have to fight to the death to get to Earth and are all alone in a strange space suit, as if they would never make it. The story of the "Road To Armageddon" is based off of a popular movie called "Airplane". The movie was directed by Tom Hanks and starred Sean Penn and Paul Scheer. (In the DVD version, it isn't quite as well known.) The original synopsis for the movie referred to the movie as " The Road To Armageddon ", but it's actually " Airplane! " Instead of speaking of Airplane!, the movie's author had a different answer for airplanes. He said that in actuality, " The earth has become a maze of labyrinthine tunnels. " It was called the Red Canyon or The Red Rock. In the movie, they travel through every single dimension or planet in the Milky Way Galaxy. So, as soon as they reach Earth, they are supposed to see aliens in their travels. But, because this is only the beginning of the story, this story was rewritten in order to give the alien race that came to Earth as an idealized version of themselves, "Arachnid Zombies". This was their main form of domination. However, they only ever use the name "The Road to Armageddon". In the original synopsis of the movie, " The Road To Armageddon" used many of the same titles as the one in The Road To Armageddon: The Earth We Live In " Airplane! " - The New Air Vehicles
