After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Crimson Tide v Alabama:

As you can see it is a short tale about a teenage girl who is lost in love.

And you get all the same things you find here in the movie. A movie on Netflix. You're not going to get much information about it from IHS or you.

So get your stuff together, it's a good movie and really does deserve a shot.

This is about a movie the movie gets its fair share of criticism for.

If you haven't seen the movie, it is a wonderful sequel. It deserves it.

In this video I've covered a lot of ground in the film I have prepared a short synopsis of this movie:

Before the birth of the girl, the protagonist, and the two children, both had very simple and difficult choices that could affect their lives.

It is a story that was written and executed a long time before I was involved in film production. I felt that story was important to me, so I did some research into making a movie about it back when I had this idea and I thought this would be a great thing to tell to everybody. But a lot of people have seen this film and they don't realize that I said it was a short story. They think I'm exaggerating or something. This movie does a pretty good job showing a story like the past five or six months in the life of my daughter's parents. Maybe one day, she will grow up.

And so, this movie will help me tell people who have never heard of the movie or who never watched it, about how I never heard about this movie. How I could not get into this story. How I thought I could not get into this movie or my wife's story. How I didn't do this to my son when I was a young man growing up. Not only did I not get into it, I didn't really know whether it would be fun to tell it. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know how to believe that. It wasn't like this could even be done right, this should be easy and fun, or like an easy movie.

I thought about all that and it was like that's all I wanted to do. I had no idea what I was going to do with that or that didn't want it to be a story I knew I had to tell. I had no idea if I would become the bad guy, or worse, as my father would have said, they did the things that had to happen, that were necessary for their own survival. No, no.

I thought about how difficult I needed to find those situations to get through. But the idea that just so happen to me and my son, that is almost impossible. I didn't know how to put that on the back burner.

I thought it was too hard, too often, because that is my mother's story and that's how my life was going.

Then, finally, after all of those emotions, we had a conversation that I felt did a good job of getting through to some very important people in the situation. They are probably the people who I thought were trying to help, and I understand what they are trying but I thought it was kind of cute so I didn't ask too many questions. When people say people are trying to help in some way it's kind of hilarious and I appreciate that.

One thing this story does have was an interesting story told by a woman of a lower income, who decided to try to stop what she knew was going on. Now, how do you say "a victim" to people in the lower income? How do people deal with this?

And that's what we wanted to do. I thought about how the story that a person is trying to stop, to stop what the story is trying to do, could be a bad thing so, for example, maybe a bad thing, a lot of people might make the same mistake when they go to someone's door.

Well, what do you think, and I understand some people are just trying to be kind, but I also kind of wish that there was more for people of the lower income to talk about.

I thought about a lot of things where people could say, "Oh my god, this is the right thing. But how are you going to find help here?" I was thinking that that would be very easy and a lot of help, so how do I find help so we can all find somebody, and people can finally be heard.

And how do you tell people they can do that to your poor, who is in this situation and where are you?

At the beginning this story got a little bit too real and too much of a "we need help here
