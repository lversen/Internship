After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Andromeda Strain, the last of the short story sequence told about a spaceship. I really tried a few different characters, ranging from the evil, cold and cruel Professor, to someone who is completely new to science fiction or sci-fi writing, to someone who does little. To say there isn't something of interest there is not always an assumption that the movie can't be a masterpiece. I know some who may say no and that I am just going to tell the whole story of that mysterious, terrible, and utterly unique character from The Andromeda Strain. But that is just my personal opinion, no specific set number or plot or script.


I can think of no reason why I didn't do some of the other short stories I read in general and on this list. I'm doing so to put it on a list that's less of a list of titles that might not exist, more of a list that is something to be done. I feel that I've done just that, at a pace better than I ever could have been in the first place. I'm going to write the story like I know now, with some of my other story ideas, and I'll let you see some examples of some of the themes and things that were here from the movies. The themes were not on this list. As you can see from the pictures, I've already included what's in my order in this list and I hope to add more to it later.


[1] I also added the movie theme, "A Life with a Star." It is called Andromeda Strain and it is one of the film's many plot twists. It's a tale of the spaceship, people, relationships and the future of a society, called Andromeda.
