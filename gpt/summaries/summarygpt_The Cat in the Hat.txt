After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Cat in the Hat.

The first part is about a teen named Alex who loses his mother when his older sister (a cat and an owl) dies. Alex is a beautiful girl with a heart that will always carry her with her through the world, and the only way to live a life of love is to protect others. As she reaches death, her heart breaks, and she becomes a dangerous predator.

The second part is about what a life can look like after loss. As Alex becomes more and more vulnerable to this new life, she gets even more fearful and has a lot to say about her actions.

But that's not the whole story. This story is about Alex and her father, Peter.

Alex, her parents, and her mother have left school with their son with no one to live with. Since this is their first home together, they are not able to have their own house and they're living at a big apartment in the suburbs, which is a very awkward situation for an 11 year old.

And though Alex is now able to interact with people in the same way she did in school, the changes she's making affect her situation, as well as the young people around her.

Alex has been forced to stop helping her stepmother if she doesn't have something to give. She can't even afford to buy a house to live on.

And now she has an option of buying an empty house. She needs help, because she can't afford it! She needs Alex to live with her friends and find another home to live in because everyone will have problems with seeing her when the kids are in school.

Now, I may not say this is exactly a perfect movie, but the movie is the real deal. I wish Alex would have been able to find the love she needs because she would have found the girl he lost that way. I wish Alex would have found a way to hold Alex up so that she could live her life at home with her friends like this without worry of being ostracized or bullied.

The movie gives her a big opportunity to make other people feel like they can just live without her because of the choice of one's life. And for it to work, she will have to make choices that are really important for other people. But she'll need help and she'll have to make them.
