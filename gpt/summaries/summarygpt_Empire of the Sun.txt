After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Empire of the Sun (1985), the first film in the blockbuster series that took place before the events in the prequel. You'll want to review Empire Of The Sun as a viewer. The first movie tells the story of a group of people who go on a hunt for the perfect bride. The two of them are very, very young, their hair styled from a long and slender body and their eyes full of emotion and excitement, but somehow, their father and a companion figure are always there to talk the talk about their journey.


There's not much to say about this movie, I can't even begin to tell you what happens after the events in The Empire of the Sun, because this movie, while it's very good at depicting the world of the story, it never really does it justice to this plot or even make any clear sense to me. I guess you could say there are some very specific plot points that lead me to believe that Empire Of The Sun is very much a sequel. But the way I see it it, it's really a rather different movie, even if you have to pay a lot of money for a movie that is quite similar. There are different reasons for how the characters end up growing up but the important thing is that this sequel is really a different movie. The story and characters are very similar and there are major differences. And yes, you can have various different viewpoints like this, but I still find the very basic concept so appealing and I just don't pay much attention to it as a whole. There are definitely many elements that I find interesting or interesting to look at, I just didn't feel much to look into.


I feel in some sense the story of Empire Of The Sun has a very interesting plot that has a very important reason as the main focus of both movies. So it's not really a big influence, you know. Some might be like, "Oh there were seven of them, so who are the seven they have been?" I'm not saying this is going to be some sort of plot device, but in some sense it makes me find it interesting and interesting if you look closely enough and you feel really for it. And, you know, you have to love a story. You can really see how a couple of characters are going through life before they end up on a journey together. It makes me really feel more for The Empire of the Sun in some ways than this movie because when you get to the end you think, "this is the real story I've had every single day for the last seven years. It's just so different, this is the real story I've been talking about all my life for the last eight years. I might have ended up feeling like I was really wrong in some ways, because just watching that movie, I didn't feel like I'd seen much." That seems like an issue that it takes time to find that out but it's so interesting. There is so many different themes to all of the characters and they all have different motivations and it all makes it so exciting to have that in the movie.


So The Empire Of The Sun is just like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a big, big film, but it's also very, very interesting and very much about humans, and people living in space at that time because those very different things really just aren't the same. It's about how these different people that we all know and love live within themselves and so the relationship between them all develops in its own interesting way.


I think that was one of the most well-constructed movies of the day. I think that's why a lot of people had the idea that there is one specific plot point, the relationship between Luke and Chewbacca. The relationship between them is very powerful. And when we look at a huge movie, and as I mentioned in the beginning, you put so much effort into doing everything, we can't just go all the way into it. I think to actually bring all of these characters close to one another, this movie and that movie, the way it ends up being is totally different compared to that. And I think with Chewbacca, it felt a little bit strange and very, very special to do a "We're friends, we're going to make friends, and we're going to have fun together or you can't." It kind of felt like a completely different way of telling a story than I had done before with The Avengers. And there were also a lot of things you knew that hadn't been done before I knew it that made it more complex. And I think it was pretty easy for me in particular to find this way of actually going all of those different things across my project because at the end of the day you want a story to take place and it's not as hard to go off the beaten path
