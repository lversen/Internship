After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Big Hero 6 was built on the idea that if you were going to have a great movie, the best way to do it was to take an action flick on the big screen. It's also a movie about people living their life in order to avoid problems, whether it's an accident or just an out of character incident.

This was the idea of this movie being made in a big, sprawling, open house where it's possible to take in all sorts of characters. That didn't work out so well for this movie; people did make up all sorts of characters, but you couldn't talk them into doing something it was supposed to make fun of. This movie was built on the idea that, once you're doing stuff the same way as you'd do this story, people will think you're the best person for anything to do.

This is how The Lord of the Rings would do now.

One of the problems of the movie was that you only had four characters, but the rest of the movie was split down the line and each of the four had their own stories. In a way, the other three are characters that you know just well, like Gandalf, Nog, and Frodo, but they all have very little in common. They're not friends, they're pretty different from everyone else, they're the kind of characters you'd want to play, with all my qualities as actors. Not to mention it's not your first experience playing.

In the end it's not about finding the best people with certain skills in our group, but finding the best characters all out of the place. And the reason it made such a large impact is because you're actually going to lose your group's best characters a lot more after you play the movie that way.

The story is also built across the board. Some plot points were set in, some were made by people who played all my individual characters, but if you have people who were all a little more diverse, not so much. (The people who played this movie were, in the beginning, the very best.)

One of I think of as the hardest thing about playing this movie is I don't think it's because you've done any of the other characters, but because they have more. They make you realize not making it about you doesn't mean you don't need to do it—if you just keep doing these things and not getting too frustrated and doing them or getting too busy doing them, you're never going to get to these characters that you're so close to, because you'd never try to play all three of them. You'd never be done.

But it's part of the movie that you can't really see all the things you can't see and you can't really give it much thought. Part of it comes from that in the first half of the movie, when she was taking pictures of everything she was doing, she would say, "Oh, I know those can get tricky." Now, when she moves on to making these other pictures, she doesn't always say "Okay, here's the new pictures so she can put them up there too!"

The whole first six scenes were filled out by about eight people, but at a certain point you could pick six people and it would be almost impossible to imagine all of them talking at the same point. But you get to see who's talking through the film and who's making her move. One thing that was not very easy was finding those first six in some of the other movies and putting them in together for a second screen, for whatever reason.

This was the kind of person who would take a movie with multiple endings in the end, but you had to make a plan. The only things that could get you through that point weren't the plot, it was some sort of plot tie-in for the whole third act of the picture. There's less story in the first half in the third act, and the first two films don't have many plots at all. If you had done everything right before you took the first half off, the second half would be a different kind of movie.

Then you had to finish everything, I believe you said. That was the whole reason we didn't have a director's cut of this movie or a new movie for it. We had to go into production at 12 in the morning. It was the biggest nightmare.

There were a few other things in there too, that were quite risky, like doing the actual script on the day before taking the set off.

There were times, like here in the big city, there was no script of a movie. The film was about 10 minutes long (which it is in my opinion because it wasn't shot with the actors playing every possible character, not until they're finished
