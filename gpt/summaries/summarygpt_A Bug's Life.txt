After this input give a synopsis of this movie: A Bug's Life. But wait... It was so bad, I couldn't get over it... I was unable to say exactly how it was so bad that it was really not an action movie at all. In fact, I'd rather never say anything more about it. Here are my best thoughts on the main plot : The movie starts, where the main character has to fight to the death against monsters from a different dimension who have been given free reign from Earth's previous control through a combination of the "bad guy" and "good guy," as we're all aware. What this movie has not made me feel is the tension between the two, how they react - or how their actions become even more of a matter of opinion. The movie is basically what it says it wants to be, about the dangers of the world, to the way humanity, of course, goes about doing good and being great in our age, how life for individuals becomes one big drama. This isn't a plot that can be interrupted quite easily ; it takes time, as if you could just find a time for it to go right to the end. This movie, however, also has scenes where a lot of the good parts of the movie don't get done. The main characters don't get what they want. No matter what happens, people who are not the main characters can still get it. They make the choices, their actions are made, so even if you're not happy, you never know what the other person will think. As a consequence, sometimes the "good" part gets out of hand, but in case you're sure that the plot isn't actually what it says, don't be afraid to say it : I think because you'll see the conclusion of this movie - a lot better than anything on the movie release.
