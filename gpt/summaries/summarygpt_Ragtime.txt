After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Ragtime, a short film about the life of an orphaned French artist nicknamed "El Guimébastien", is set in Paris during a time when the French government has not taken in such young talent.

But what really sets this story apart from most horror films of this genre, and as a result, feels more authentic on a more personal level, is the setting of the novel by the Italian director Francesco Pagnotta. The main characters are a boy named Marcelo and a young girl named Joanne.

Both are born from poor families (and, as ever, one who can't afford to be fed) and come with unique personalities. The two protagonists and the author's own struggles to cope with their different experiences, also seem to fit perfectly in the book. They are both gifted filmmakers, but at the same time, they are also both gifted writers (with very different stories and styles like a well written short film by a British director whose work is often overlooked). However, with each project, Pagnotta tries to bring the two personalities together to create one unique story and a more coherent style that can appeal to a huge audience.

Francesco Pagnotta has a great understanding of the art literature and cinema, and his unique vision of cinema, his approach to the medium and ideas that inform cinema are both impressive. The book also manages to have an interesting world view as both authors also share different strengths, but it is a good read to begin with as neither has the resources to tackle all the issues as both work well over their respective lives.

An important fact of my review of the book (in which I highlighted the work by Francesco Pagnotta in more detail): if you are not a horror fan, this book is your best chance to know the real deal about the film, and you might end up wondering why so many horror authors are so afraid of writing in a film format, especially when they have not done so before for films from the genre.

Pagnotta is a very unique filmmaker, with an idea of cinema that is not just an idea of what cinema should look like, but also a story of a child, lost in the film world.

The story begins with a child, and when a boy from a very poor family calls out for some food to feed him, no one comes to him - because he does not look like a kid but just resembles his father's older brother or two, and is rather too old to feed him food. But when Marcelo and Joanne come across a young boy named Victor and take him into their own place (no one wants this kid, for example), everything changes, and they feel no need to care about him, and therefore find themselves at some kind of loss. This is a strange twist of fate that will make life difficult for Marcelo and Joanne over the coming days, as the story ends with them getting in a situation where Marcelo and Joanne decide to make each other into animals without having any children for the first time in decades.

Francesco Pagnotta's short story "The Childless", which is as unique and imaginative as you will ever get on a short film, shows Marcelo, a very young and very young lad, with a beautiful voice and a very young body as he takes out his clothes to meet some beautiful girls.

The main protagonists are French artist Marcello and a young boy known as Ralf who is a talented performer who is very intelligent, in spite of his very poor eyesight. Marcelo and Ralf, who can take it to a certain way, have just seen one of their favorite performers, a girl called Sébastien, a young girl named Marie, and who the authors have found very suitable to fill this role. Together with this, Marcelo and Marcello can create a completely different concept of the love for children, and can also make children believe in what they believe in, without having to see a lot of proof in front of them. Because of Marcelo, Marie will be able to see that something is still hidden within her, and her desire to be part of something truly special is able to lead her on a journey of redemption, just as the story of Margot (the book's protagonist) starts.
