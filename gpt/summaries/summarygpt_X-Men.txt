After this input give a synopsis of this movie: X-Men 'X-Men: Apocalypse'' X-Men: Age of Ultron'' X-Men: Apocalypse/ The Matrix - Part 1 : Part 2 : Part 3

I should start by explaining what this movie is about and how I feel about its plot. There are two major major stories involved. The X-Men: Apocalypse and Age of Ultron: Apocalypse is set in a modern world where mutant life has been severely disrupted in the face of a new generation of heroes known as the X-Men. While the X-Men are well positioned to save the day during the events of the movie and the ongoing conflict between mutants and the criminal organizations known as the White Walkers, they must face all odds against both mutants and the X-Men and ultimately defeat the last X-Men before they reach an end with their own endgame. This movie is directed by Michael B. Jordan and will feature strong dialogue and plenty of good character moments. The first scene is the climax and there is a lot of action involved. The X-Men are led by Xavier, who is still working off his secret identity, and he gives off an X-Ranger vibe to the character that has him in turmoil or even questioning his powers. This X-Men is so young he can't understand the role of the X-Men, but also isn't entirely sure what he is being told and can help to get answers for others or to keep the other side from becoming too arrogant.

The second scene in the film starts with a scene at the end that has me rethinking everything I've read about this film and what I believe it will prove. X-Men: Apocalypse is set in a post-apocalyptic future. As the events of the movie come to light mutants in the 19th century suddenly began to flourish in their modern world. This movie is about how an American and European civilization is fighting against the advances of technology by means of technology that only the best will ever have. As a result the technology that we have continues to expand and the abilities that we have now come to call it the Human Race. The film starts with a fight between scientists that will take place in the '20s and 30s. The battle is led by Jean Grey and the world is at war with a race of mutant soldiers named The X-Men. While the characters fight for dominance the humans win and The X-Men were all driven mad for the defeat but the real motivation of the movie is to unite the entire human race. There is a lot of action and a lot of character drama. The X-Men become so powerful because they have already achieved tremendous victories, but this will continue on. We find the human race led by Jean Grey and his allies fighting one another to win their power by defeating the world which has caused the world to become extinct.

Jean Grey plays the role that was left vacant during the first film. The main event of this trilogy is the conclusion of the X-Men storyline arc. While this is going to be the first arc in the series, we will not see any of the main characters back together during the course of this story. When you re-watch the X-Men: Apocalypse movie, I can really relate to his experience of being raised in a world where all humans were controlled with fear and control. Jean Grey had a hard time accepting being who he was and wanted to do whatever it took for him to reach his potential and become one of the greatest, smartest, most powerful and self-confident young heroes to ever live this side of the screen. This movie is about a young hero who comes to the end of his days and comes of age in a post-apocalyptic world where the technology that we have now begun to bring about has changed all over the place. His life and abilities have changed so much, we have no idea what he will do in the future. We are not yet sure who he will become but he will know very soon.

There is an incredibly interesting piece of dialogue here as well. As all the characters tell us they will join forces to kill mutants and gain power to do so. As soon as the X-Men get their powers the mutants learn to become more powerful. The story really starts when an over-achieving mutant team attempts to destroy the world, causing a major civil war. The group attempts to take over the world and are led by Jean Grey along with their fellow X-Men. The X-Men are able to defeat three teams of mutants from the group and start to turn the tide in their favor. They do this from a place where they know there won't be any mutants left. After that the X-Men decide to take and complete their mission and move on to the future. With the mutant army's power they reach the end of the world and gain power. This story really is
