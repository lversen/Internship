The following is a list of some of the most reliable sources for all of the movies in the movie "Nanofascist".

S. D. Stearns' (1913-2005-Aesthetics) book on the first and last days of WWII

P. L. H. Keating's "Missions and Experiences"

Davies - "the French are trying to conquer Australia, and it's like it's really, really bad... the United States is losing all of them, their only hope is the French-speaking population coming through. Is it really right to look at this as a game, to believe that they're trying to get us to war? And they might just be the ones making the bombs. Is it possible they're trying to win or are they trying to control the world's populations in order to control them?"

The English language magazine "The Daily Mail" is also one of the two most reliable sources in the movie for WWII information. However, it is important to remember that, for decades, the National Library of the British Empire was the only source of information about the country without an official official government. The National Library is the government organization that publishes documents and gives special attention to issues which appear classified or to be confidential to a certain degree. And the Government Library in England is the government organization and the one which publishes documents which clearly states what the government does in a particular situation. The National Library and the National Archives of the United States are two separate offices that were never in direct competition to one another and that were not at all tied together by an official order. The National Archives was established with the purpose of publishing documents and materials which did not belong in one organization. The National Archives is the only government library in the developed world which is allowed the right of access to the documents and materials it has in one of its offices for the sole purpose of publishing these documents and documents which we have now used to present information about World War II to the world.
