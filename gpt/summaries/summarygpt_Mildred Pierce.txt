After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Mildred Pierce/Alfred Allen/Diana Farrow/Clarence Foster Wallace (Luna Loves Pussy) [1]. Pierce is a black woman who has been raped and abused by a man. One night, in a bar, Pierce finds a girl in a hotel room lying still by a door, a bath and a handkerchief in her hand. She wakes up to find a man who had apparently been raped and is now sexually abused by the same man. The man returns and says that he heard this incident during their marriage night. Pierce does not know what to do because he cannot even recall the name of his wife - he does not know anyone and his job as a detective doesn't include calling the police. She says she doesn't remember what happened because she didn't know anybody or there wasn't anything to worry about. The man tries to tell her that he doesn't remember anything and if he does, she has to tell him where he lives. Her job is to protect her from this terrible man so that they don't have to deal with things like this again. She agrees and she goes to see a therapist after a week at a hotel and talks about it. She has to ask for help for a lot of things so she doesn't have to do that. She tries to speak English and she is afraid of the guy. Later she discovers that she actually had multiple rapes in front of her as a single. (In this movie she has a boyfriend.) Pierce and his wife have never had intimate relations but they are going through a divorce, Pierce is in college and he has a daughter. It is after this that he learns how to make his wife drink from a vial of water before going public with his plan. [The synopsis for this film contains numerous references to sexual innuendos and is not intended to be a substitute for your own understanding. The only one that can possibly make that connection is Pierce's voice playing in the film in which his character is heard in a sexual perversion scene, in which he was physically abused by a male prostitute and this sex act ends up happening after he is raped and the woman tries to kiss him as an homage to the "big dicks." I'll address the fact that it is a metaphor for Pierce's rape and a metaphor that his wife later uses to get to him after the rape but then gets trapped by the emotional reaction of his child.]
