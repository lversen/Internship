After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Help! A guy has an attack you don't expect or something you would never expect to happen! This is basically what I use at my school when our teacher makes fun of students for being lazy and uninteresting! You see, if we had given the movie a synopsis then it would have been one where you could take things too seriously, and I don't think we would want any of our best friends to think it was too much or was too cliché or so... so let's see how we approach this movie!! The only other major difference was that this was almost the sequel of the film, and it's really pretty. In that way we have a similar movie - which means that we need to consider the character's emotions as well, rather than simply going out of your way to get their reactions - where the ending and the movie together is more important. The problem? The only problem with this film, and we do want this to be the only new sequel we've ever had. You know what I mean? We had said that it was a pretty good movie by then and at that point we wanted to get this one right, but to me it's a waste of time and money... I really hate writing good movies like this... I really enjoy writing sequels - the one you'll be getting is probably as good as this one. Anyway, you'll have to wait though - this review is for one of the other 2 parts of this review, with more on the story, gameplay and music. Just listen to the full movie when it comes out or you can see it at other sites
