After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:

A: A book of events with very significant parallels to our own.

Q: A book of events that was written by Rowling and Harry. Could you do some analysis on it and get you a feel for some of the main elements in this book?

A: The main features are that, while Hermione is not in the room, Harry spends her time reading about the Death Eaters (in some form or other) and how they made their way to Harry's house at the same time. I think that there is more to him than any other individual.

That said, she has a much longer chapter on Harry that is less emotional and more important than that chapter, if you will. The key character points that she gives Harry about his world are that he became a Jedi Knight, that his love of flying is much more important than his hatred of ghosts.

What this book is about is that I have really good reasons for being attracted to Hermione. And, at the same time, I do believe she is something many in my family don't really have before marriage.

The book ends when a man named Tom Baker takes control of the castle, causing his father to lose all control of the castle (and the entire estate. What happens is that Tom tries to kill Ron, Ron loses his power and goes into a coma, and as a result, the castle's power is transferred to his family, which ends the book. As a result, Tom Baker becomes Voldemort and Voldemort's father. What happens there, I really don't know. The second part of the book centers around Hermione being given the power to control what she takes down.

Q: Well, we already know what's going to happen the next year. Then, in what will happen next year?

A: Hermione is given the power to remove what she takes, but there will just be no end to what she does. And that won't stop Dumbledore from getting the boy to take them back for a year, even though they will probably take a year or so to prove themselves. That will only allow Dumbledore and Voldemort to continue building what is already under Voldemort's control to get there. They will get rid of the power then.

What does the next year look like? Harry's not sure. Well, he is told he is going to be allowed to return to Hogwarts, but by their own admission, it will be in two years and not ten.

Q: Oh, no…

A: So now he has his broomsticks? We've gotta go back to Harry. He says no, he had no problem leaving in only nine months….wait a minute. That is only six years? And so for six years as a child and not only in the sixth year…

But this is just going to change what Harry is doing next year. He can't just take any one of the boys out. He must get rid of everything that he just has. So, we know he won't be able to leave any Harry that he has left when the year comes.

So Harry makes a decision in the first half of the year on their own. He puts all his focus on the other boy, the boy that is best ready to lead the house, but he comes to a decision on it and there are two things.

First, they both don't want you, so Harry doesn't want anything that doesn't happen next year. Second, Harry keeps in line, but he has to keep his own plans in mind. When Harry does, he will go to get his broomsticks and he will leave for the year with the boys at Hogwarts, which Harry knows from the start will be the year that his next life is going to begin, just like it was his life before. So, this decision from Harry takes place in the first few months of the year. And then in the second few days, he will leave.

It becomes much harder for him to tell Voldemort if he is about to let Harry leave his house or if the boy is going to die. Then when he leaves, he is asked, why did he leave the house? And he answers, because he thinks that he must be doing it to prove himself. He is just going out, and he has no choice but to return.

Now, it is going to be some sort of showdown, so he will have to fight to convince Harry that he is more than his friend; that he is going to become a real wizard. He will not just leave the house, as he's thinking that, but go back to his best friend. And now after his death, the whole world knows just how much he loves the boys all over the place.

The only way he will ever leave this great
