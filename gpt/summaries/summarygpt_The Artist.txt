After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Artist: a brief examination of the world of Jack Lee and a bit of the other films of that era. This movie starts off as a small tale set in a little town known as Stiles. Things start off nice and quickly turns around, but for the rest of the film it was about three and a half hours. The story isn't told like most of the rest of the movies. It starts off as an old college-to-career student of the arts named John Cusack who is very much a part of the town. He's quite old and, as a result, has an enormous problem when it comes to getting into an art class. His only chance to get to an art school is in the town hall where he is asked to sign up for one. Here John goes out and gets the first opportunity. At first you might think he just took off his coat. As he tries to be a part of society and live his life in a way that doesn't make sense, but eventually he learns that he has to work harder and be more willing to participate in society. It gets the story set up so well to be that the town hall becomes the stage and the actual class begins, and John continues. It was interesting to explore John and his feelings for not being able to go to an art school because of things like that. It started out as a small-town boy who would ask the best art class he could find and find a teacher that would go as far as helping him. The art class was a challenge for the young man, but it turned out to be a way for him to make it at home and to get his grades down to a decent level. After doing this for a few days, he began moving to a smaller town called Dixie, where he is still a part of the social class and being that part of the town, he has to be able to make other people around him better. However, not only are they different and he needs to learn different things, but some of their teachers have issues with him getting his training.

This story does have a little bit of a plot to it, but the second half of the movie is much more dramatic in the early chapters. The story just starts out as an accident that happened to one of the art classes. Then it progresses into a time machine. The story really begins to take off in the second half of the movie when John and John's mom who lives in a small house come to visit. Soon John is having a very hard time accepting John's family and wants to help him with matters they're not doing.

The Movie takes place in the same town that Joss Whedon is working in and in the city at war with: "The Avengers". That name is a reference to the popular X-Men franchise, a movie that was released in 2000 and took a little more time than it should have, but at least it started from a place known as the "Great Divide". The Great Divide was a region in the United States of America where people were divided into the rich and the poor, which caused them tremendous problems, and a divide that grew over time until one of the major groups that emerged was the black community in the United States. That divide was called the "Illusion". It was a time where people were getting more and more comfortable in their own skin (or at least in what they are getting today), and where these black individuals would fight each other for scraps. The illusion had one of two things in it, if it existed: 1) the people who did not get those scraps became more and more like them, and 2) the people who did get those scraps ended up in some way that resulted in getting rid of those who did not get those scraps in their favor. This story would get used as a cover story the second half of the next movie because of the different ways people died. Also, some of the black folks would eventually die, so they'd be like, "Don't look, because somebody's dying. I'm not here to help them." The second half of the movie was not a story about black people dying, and many characters were more than their fair share of them. It was a narrative about the relationship between people who die in this way and people who stay on top and maintain a sense of life and health and well being, and I still believe those are the things that will be explored.

My friend Tom Scholze is a professor of English and philosophy emeritus at New York University and author of the bestselling Best American Comics and The Death Cure. His work has appeared in most of the major scholarly works on the Internet and I really enjoyed watching this. After reading this I found my interest in his work somewhat tempered by the fact that the rest of his book is written over a year ago and he's still learning to
