After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Last King of Scotland (1996) by Ben Smith, with the screenplay written by James McAvoy (who starred in an earlier draft of the film). The film has two sequels, and then the third, and the fourth, and the fifth.  The three movies were both directed by McAvoy, and each was an absolutely perfect adaptation of his character, so there was a definite desire to get things straight that could possibly be made with the money the studio had spent to develop their ideas.
A final note. If you are considering making this movie online (which I assume is very important if you have been involved in the film distribution process), you may have been inspired to do so by an anonymous blog post I wrote about that very day, in which a huge percentage of the fan base gave up trying to make this movie with a third sequel, and said as much for the money that was needed to make such a movie a reality. On September 28st 1995, a commenter linked to this post, and said that I had gotten the picture in their heads that if the Kickstarter campaign was funded with Kickstarter $15k would be enough to finish the screenplay, the third movie would come out and I was doing great, thus I was in this movie now to start with, this is why I wrote that original blog post, which was very early in the process of getting the page on-line: I'm so glad we're able to publish our information now. That said, I'm not satisfied with that; I don't expect your support to succeed. The most important thing is that you and the community will give this movie the attention and attention it deserves.
Sincerely, James McAvoy The Director
While there is a bit of a backlash from critics, and some fans, I was initially unable to convince my fellow movie buffs that The Last King of Scotland was a good movie. The first trailer I saw showed some of the CGI, but this trailer is nothing but CGI. I was in the area of 'experience' in a couple of days and saw one of the scenes for the second trailer and it didn't make sense; it was not realistic, and it was certainly not realistic when I went to the set.  I wasn't aware this trailer used some of the same weapons and effects as the first trailer; this also happened to be the same kind of set that worked for the first film and was a different kind of set for the second movie.  
For a while after that, it all came back to me, but I had to do a quick and dirty search for the trailer again so that my review and movie review might help. It looked like this, as well:
But wait! We get to see The Last King of Scotland now....
I saw this trailer at a theater during my two days at New York City Comic-Con. As I walked by it to the front the trailers still showed. When I walked into the theater for my first screening, all the trailers I had seen were with new footage that had also been shot at this theater. I was told this by several people, that they had already seen the trailers in the NYCC. As soon as I got to the theater, I realized that not every trailer showed.   When I looked at every set of trailers I had seen before, the trailers that had been shot before were still there. I also saw one of the trailers showed with a "scatter screen".   As some people are aware, I found the trailer in a local movie store. When I was looking at the trailer there, that's when I started to believe that it was just a publicity stunt. I then decided to try and identify it. I'm very grateful for all of my work in making this movie, and the feedback so far from me. I'm very excited to finally know what the people at New York City Comic Con have in common in order to see The Last King of Scotland (1995).  
The Last King of Scotland (1995)
Based on the original screenplay of the movie, with a reshot of the title card from The Last King of Scotland. This was a film directed by McAvoy (who had previously worked on another John W. Campbell Jr. movie, The Last King and A Stranger in Tibet). The film features a retelling of the epic tale, "The Last King of Scotland: the story of the Last King of Scotland, which goes hand in hand with all its themes, themes of greed, and greed for power," and the movie was released in Japan with the bonus "Marauder of Fear."
Though the movie contains quite a bit of character development between both the actors. There is really no plot difference that is noticeable between first and second of the movie (but if the second is a bit too dramatic, it could be something that can be explained simply by
