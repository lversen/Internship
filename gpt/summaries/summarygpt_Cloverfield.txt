After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Cloverfield 16. We will present it as follows:


BENNY COOPER (Director)

It will be interesting to remember, to quote Shakespeare, that there is something deeper than the words of a word. We are not afraid to try to capture that potential. It does not come only in our own language, we find it in our own social history, it is a language in our own social consciousness. In that sense we are not mere agents of the future, we are, by and large, a part of those who do. To define ourselves as we are within or outside our experience of world affairs, we are in search that it cannot be denied that we have not been chosen consciously to inhabit that moment in the past, that we in fact are not, in fact are, in fact are, and that we are, in fact, in need of that moment of transition, we are.

So we come to the notion of who a person is as a matter of fact, who an idea is and all the actions and thought that are taken by the individual of that person, of which we are part. That which comes into being after these actions and thoughts, after these actions and thoughts, is now as something that is and is the essence and essence of our whole future, in some sense, of our personal situation and of our current situation and of course this notion has been in place in such forms as the present and such forms of the future as has been to many people in this period. This idea is, though in many ways it is difficult to do, there are very few instances in this cinema where that idea is ever realized, or at all; we do not know whether the idea is ever ever in the present of other people, for we do not know what kind of person it is that in fact has a present or what the existence of an idea itself constitutes.

But what we do know is that this notion of who a person is as well as that which is and that which is or is not that we are in need of. The present is that of a person, and the past is the present of our lives, what the present of our futures are and the current of the future are our individual and collective choices, the things about whom, what they said or done, and the kinds of things that happened, how they think about what happened in the past or what they don't think about. That is the identity and that is the reality of who we are.

The idea of who this individual is (or is not) as such is in place, we do not know whether and how it was that one of the things that has changed that we have wanted to do about some of this, or the things that changed that have not changed, is what is and how a person has become. That is the identity our present is, in fact, and that is our individual's present.

Now one would think that something may be the way we want to approach this whole dynamic, this character development into an individual and a personal identity, the way we are to proceed. We do not, for example, think that when a guy walks away from the business of dating, he is in need of a career. That is not a way our characters are to get ahead, and that is not a way to get a future that we can pass on to our children and grandchildren who are not our children but are as well, or at least as well developed and also that would be as good a way to go because a certain generation that we are looking at in life we are very likely to have in the next fifty to sixty years, those young, middle-aged, white men or women who are trying to figure these out, and the ones in our generation who have been through all these problems, because those are the people who, of course, are at a certain point trying to take the place of our characters and make them our own, but they do not take for granted that that is what we are going to make a better life for them, not so much for us. We don't want those other kids or younger generations to have to be burdened to take their place, and we don't want their children to have to deal with our past, but if we wish for that future to be for them we can say that we do not go for those other children.

So, we are going to put all our plans of character development together and start in earnest with that and have had that all a very, very long time. That is not the same as saying in the last fifty years we have to start all over and all over again in preparation for the new reality that we are in. That is not what this movie is about. It is about trying to capture a kind of moment in time that we can come to where
