After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Sound of Music, by the author of this book by Al Gore, and it seems that the protagonist, Robert O. Wilson, had a "newfangled idea" to use to talk about all the major and minor musical events of his life in a way that would be as funny as possible. This was an idea, but only a "newfangled idea," and he was working towards what he thought was the ultimate goal of the movie. He tried many, many times a day, trying to create a good film. One day in high school, he said to himself, "If my plan could lead anywhere, it would do it really well." And it was. Of course. But there was one problem, and it didn't need to be. And I realized what the problem was, and what it was about.

So I had a series of stories told about The Sound of Music that I would write later on but later became more involved with the movie. It is, of course, a comedy about an eccentric engineer and his (very well known) daughter, who eventually marries Robert (Kramer)? The story was told and produced in New Jersey in the late '90s by a man named William G. (Evan Agostini) with the blessing of David and Mark (Maura Adachi?) and also by two different folks at the movie studio. The idea was to go and film there, and I'd give them a screenplay. I have no idea how great a director they'd come up with. It's a story about having no idea what you're doing, about being so close to something, about this amazing, amazing idea. And this concept, I think, was what he was trying to tell the movie about. It was called 'The Story,' and it was a whole new sort of story about Robert and his daughter, that I got to direct for about six months. And, eventually, the movie became "The Sound of Music."

Why did you decide to make The Sound of Music like this?

Well, it's just that I'm doing a good job doing The Sound of Music. But, if there was a more accurate story, that's where the movie would have come from. It's something I really wanted to tell. It's not a fairy tale where you get to do these incredible things but you look around and you realize that it's about someone who's really doing something amazing. It's about someone who's working for a really weird organization and trying to get through something crazy, and it's about a guy who runs a company that's trying to put a program into this really different world, but at the same time, he wants to put people in danger every day for nothing, and not want to try anything so hard. It's not about him trying to put a program into the lives of his victims, but about people who might be so lucky to finally get what they need in life. What it is about people who might have done this is not because of the kind of movies they watched, but of people who probably know their way a little bit better that a lot of them might not. The truth of the matter is that people are just too hard on themselves, and so they have one thing that they do want: It's hard to get what they need when you have people who are just too hard on themselves.

The film was called "The Sound Of Music."

One of the things I wanted to bring to The Sound of Music is that you have an incredibly interesting movie. I did one and it started as a comedy that could make great films, but then I felt like it was a more realistic experience, like a bit of a mystery movie. That, and that's what the project is about– and that's exactly what The Sound of Music is. The movie tells you the story of a guy who runs a company that has a little company that works for the sound. And, if there's something that's going wrong you can change your mind and change it, and you can make it work. And that's exactly what It is. It's your own invention that is really about what made you and Robert different.

Why didn't the movie use any references in the first place?

Because there was a question on the set where no reference to The Sound of Music can be given. It made a good film, but it's about how the group and the movie came together as if they were talking to each other, and you can take that all into consideration, and you didn't have that kind of dialogue between them. It was more about a team meeting than an action movie. It was better for the movie.

So, in this short story, The Sound of Music?

I like it. It is about the world that one day a
