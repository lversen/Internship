After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Salvador Dali (1972-1977), in his final years (1964-1973) and '74 (after a two-to-four hour period as a director), directed a movie "in my opinion," based on the '80's classic "This Is the End of Films." He is especially credited for the movie that follows the last few hours in the late 00's. According to this title, "After this, I was already ready to tell the world about a time when I had no memory of his final day in Hollywood — because he had so little of the time in which we talk about films and television." The film shows the true story of the life and legacy of Pablo Picasso, a surrealist painter and scientist who inspired many artists to make his famous paintings a reality.

The film begins with a film clip of Picasso in France. Later on, in France you can see the famous photo of the former director in the video below:

The film ends in a bit and we get all of the following. On one of the first screen shots we get a picture of Picasso with two characters: a father and daughter, who are in a room together in the middle of the movie. We get the name Salvador Dali. It seems that when his work reaches his limits we can only wonder what is right for his character.

What follows is what an expert has described as a "bluesome and fascinating story … an extraordinary film". We get a great performance from the man who turned Picasso into an icon. He had a very strong and intense and often hilarious personality, who had a lot of power. He felt that his work, that he was able to have great impact on the world at large. He truly felt that he was capable of bringing an entire country together, to give it a sense of unity. He is such a unique and special person in the picture.

As you can see the camera pulls away and you can't help but see other people's faces as if they are sitting there, seeing Picasso while thinking in his mind of how he could accomplish this task. He has a unique expression of his sense of dignity, and of his power to make anyone look nice. As we see him go towards Picasso, the other side of his face comes to his relief and he lets go of his hands, says "I could kill you and your whole country!" and walks away. You can probably see some of the faces of these other young people on this movie.

On the set of "I Am Not There": (in Dutch) Diego Rivera (played by Ewan McGregor).

Dali and the young people with him, we must always listen to the story of Salvador Dali and the work he is doing. You know that, I love a good story. And it shows on the screen that it is about being a really rich man, and that it is an art that is really very effective. It shows about an amazing career, of working for his family. And it shows on the screen, that this life is beautiful and it is a life that is interesting because he, was able to come out of a very difficult situation, and had many things, but to a certain extent that means, this is a life that is also in the light of an extraordinary life, and so it is a life that is very good. He came out from a very tough life and he is happy, but he went to a very lucky life. It is difficult and he comes out with this remarkable life, but you can understand about it really the fact, it is the life of a person who had quite a hard time not coming out from him. Like in the film we see that he tries to be very responsible and very responsible in this film. And he was in this situation and he doesn't always get what way one is supposed to feel.

As you can see it is very difficult to get out of a tough situation where you go from one life experience to the next, and then from one life experience to another. And in many ways, to get to be on a high level. However, to get to that level, one is really trying to be really disciplined, so you always have to think through what one is going through that you would never have done by doing this. But at the end of one life experience one is able to realize it in another world, and what an amazing life. So if you have been doing this type of work for four years … do not be afraid that all the people you know won't get a chance to see you.

I think that "I Am Not There" is very inspiring to learn about the life path of the Pablo Picasso. I am also very grateful to everyone who knows him who has given him their approval. For my
