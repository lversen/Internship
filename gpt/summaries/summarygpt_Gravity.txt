After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Gravity Falls's plot centers on the fall of an aging, orphaned lesbian couple, Anna and Tilda, who are desperate to establish a "safe haven" in Florida to seek a cure for their growing depression.

What I like most about Gravity Falls (by far) is the opening and running theme of this film, with the story being one of redemption to the doomed couple; of course, that's all you really have to know about this one. I also like that they have many more options on what to choose than there are in this movie (although they don't really have a choice). I can't wait to see what the next movie has in store for Goliaths in this category.

So, if you want to see more of an 'Ascension' sequel, this is your guy! So be sure to check this out! I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, I know we already talked about Gravity Falls' upcoming trailer a lot!

For those of you that missed the trailer, we've got a pretty good review of Gravity Falls below. I'm going to go a little bit longer on this then I usually do:

The Trailer

(Warning: These are spoilers of the trailer, but I'm going to wait and see if they're accurate. Sorry, though, we're just going to say it's gonna make you want to read it next time.)

The Trailer I want to do The first thing every guy should know: don't watch Gravity Falls. Even if they aren't gonna do it in theaters. The problem with it is that there is really no way to actually do that. Gravity Falls tells a dark, very gritty story with a terrible premise. It leaves you thinking that that'll just make you more convinced of who this person was, and that the only way you can really be sure about that is by sitting in the theater watching the movie, staring intently at the theater curtains until the curtain starts to close. It leaves you confused, worried that the entire scene was just another elaborate, poorly executed, elaborate elaborate lie. Maybe the show is doing something great, and the plot isn't exactly good enough… So, if you're a director looking for a good story, Gravity Falls needs to have a good production, and an awful one. Well, I suppose it was. But when it comes to Gravity Falls, it's not. You can't create a great narrative. You need a cast, and a cast that plays to your strengths and doesn't take you out of each other's arms.

As for the synopsis itself, it begins on a page that isn't really there, not because this page isn't there, but because the first paragraph is confusing to read, and not because there's a long section in between lines that might not have been fully formed. Well, yeah, I know that's really the worst. But I'll show you one paragraph that I think really should have been left intact.

Next up, let's take another look.

We start by talking about one character: the character's father. Sure, I understand that the first and second seasons did not have his death, but how long was it before he was killed? Who was his father? Why was The Flash having trouble reconciling the relationship between his father and The Flash that went beyond being a normal part of the story? It's only when we delve into this character that everything happens to come together that we really understand exactly why it's that he was killed. And this is my favorite episode of the series, because when you have the right to be angry and crazy and to love and to hate and hate just as deeply as I do, and that's what so many of you have in life, it really goes to show that you don't get to be what you hate. I think that this story is so very, very important because I've seen my entire life (and life will take me back a long time to this day), and it's just such a terrible story. And like you said, because of how it's written, it's such a terrible story so it took a lot to tell. But that's why it's so funny, it's because it's so great! You know what the funniest day was when you got home, and it was… this is how great it is. Every time people are like, "Wow. This is great! This must be great, we are really into this whole thing!" They're like, "Well, there's a lot of stuff out there. But then, why are we all so bad and horrible at each other? Because of the way that it turned out, that was the last time we really tried to build something really awesome and awesome and awesome together!" So I loved having that in the credits and going
