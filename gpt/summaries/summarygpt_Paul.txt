After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Paul & Alice: Lost Children [1987]:

I. The Road: The Story of "The Road to Paradise" by James Cagney (a.k.a. THE WALLBURN, The Road to Paradise by B.C. Andrews) in the second act as the narrator,

II. Paul's Day: A Story of Love, Friendship, and Family by Bob Dylan in the second act:

This movie has a lot of special effects and that one was done in a way that they didn't leave a lot of room for error. One big character with this little background and one main character where there's very special effects is the movie's main character, the American who's known as "Paul." This character was played by a man or woman known as Paul Jovone. There is no major exposition about this character so the only part of this movie that we see is the character he loves, Alice. Alice is portrayed by a beautiful woman named Lucy. This woman is a great actress that Alice loves so much. I think he would really like to get her to look very chic. She is the kind of heroine she portrays in real people.

There is one other minor scene in the movie where the couple makes a deal (part of the screenplay) with each other.

I am only about 9 years old and can't remember anything about the movie at this point. I think this movie was set to be very similar to The Road to Paradise, the one where the real character was an American named Paul Jovone, played by a guy named Lucy. Paul came across his neighbor as I do, from my perspective. He looks like a middle aged man or woman. This is the same Lucy that I remember in The Road to Paradise, played by a guy played by Ira Sargent who is actually played by James Cameron. I remember the first scene where the Englishman, a middle aged man named Oliver, tells Paul, "You are in love with God, and you don't have to change one thing about yourself, you can change my mind." This character is very old at the end of this movie.

A lot of it is about being an alcoholic and then being told in your twenties that you're not quite right. At the very least, the title of this movie makes you think. I don't know if it's very old and it's a lot of love being told to me. People are not quite ready for it. This time of year they tell them about the cold, the cold weather, that we are a year out. And this is exactly what Paul is taught to be. He takes two college friends to the beach one night. He wants to go fishing, but they agree to bring a bag of oysters. Paul asks Alice if she likes the experience. She responds that she likes the water. She loves it. She leaves Paul alone and comes back at the last minute, with the same question: Is that okay with you, Alice? (As I say as Alice to myself, "Not yet". It's not yet clear if we're meant to just agree with what Alice told me here. What are we really supposed to ask Alice about? Are we supposed to pretend we think she's different?)

The character of Paul, played by Paul Jovone is often misapplied by the other movie actors. But I can already tell what Paul had to say in the second act of the movie I'm about to watch that it was not about being too nice to Alice. It was "What would you want someone to say about you? I believe you would want to love her every moment of your life. Love you every moment." (He has a lot of love for Alice and is very close with her that night.) And I like Alice. He loves her because of the way she looks. He knows what is at stake in her heart but he also cares for her. He doesn't understand why I thought that was at all about him. I think that he is very self aware. I also wonder if it is partly his sense of worth that makes Alice's choices as a character so important to him. He doesn't just want her to have a nice new life. He's an introverted guy to Alice. Paul is a very introverted guy, in a way, because his emotions are very introverted and he likes what Alice is going through. He wants to talk to her without ever really changing or not. Paul can seem self obsessed and self loathing at times. In this film a lot of it is about her and him taking on a role of character and that role is one where Paul Jovone wants to get that character right and she doesn't want him to change just to tell her what to think. I can't imagine how Paul and Alice would want a different
