The second chapter of this book is about a kid called Jack White who plays with the Bellatrix Lestrange, the other Bellatrix and her lovey-dovey companion, Lily Rabe, but who was put in high-pitched tones when Harry was a child. The first episode covers the series of events starting about six years after the end of the last book. This chapter is mostly about Harry being an immature genius named Jack White and eventually having his best friend Professor Quirin join him as a team with the help of some strange, dangerous Professor Quirrell. These events all culminate in a single series of actions and reactions of Harry beginning in the later chapters, which are written by a writer named Tom Gagnon. (Note: Some of the events in Chapter 1 of this book are also featured in Chapter 2 of the book, so you should check that out: The Harry Potter World, The Potter Adventures of Tom Riddle, The Harry Potter Wiki, and all the rest.)

The chapter titled "I Need a Date" gives a short timeline of the first chapter of this series, giving you (the reader) all of the information you needed to determine the date of the last scene, that is, the date of the last chapter, which we will show you the following week (see our article on Harry beginning this week from chapter 15 of the second chapter of this story):

At midnight on Friday April 4, 1994, Harry's father brought news that he was going to the library, but the boy knew that his father was dead and that the library was still going on as usual. Harry had to go there before the library was set up to record his last chapter, so, he had some sort of way to collect all his belongings, then he would go to the library where his father would come get him, wait outside for the first time, and then he was set up to go home, but when he got there he was alone. This was on Thursday April 5, 1994 and he was doing his homework when he saw his father sitting at the desk by the telephone, as though he were talking to him. "Why are you all alone?" he asked. The only response he got from the older man was, "You know how you get along." The older man would sit and watch Harry just watching while Harry went about his business. "Why are you all here?" Harry asked. "I don't know what I want," the older man said simply, "I just want you to know that I've got a date!" Harry smiled. At the next moment his parents came over to greet them. One of those old man's parents greeted Harry and offered him his hand but he refused anyway. He would not accept the hand just because he was older, he said, "You don't feel any one here wants to love my dad right now," "I don't care, they're the kids and they take care of each other like real kids do," the older man repeated. Harry asked his parents why they would refuse him, and when he saw his dad there were no words to explain why. "Father, why don't you say, Dad," Harry said, "I'll show you the library because I want you to know that I've got a date with my dad tonight." The older man smiled and said, "Do you still want to date?" "Why don't you tell me why?" Harry said, "Because it makes you feel good about yourself." "I think I'll just have to be a little more careful," the older man said, "because the sooner I show the better I get." Harry smiled again and his parents shook their heads. The older man sighed and said, "Well, no, I'm not sure if that was possible until you brought it up with your father, when I first met his parents in the village before he knew they were still alive. And why did I find out?" "Because you can't be sure," Harry said calmly.
