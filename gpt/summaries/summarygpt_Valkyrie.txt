After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Valkyrie's mother was a human who used to live in a cave where there are no humans as it said, for several decades, she would wander the earth at nights because the world is too dark. I suppose that the main reason it's not so much a Valkyrie movie as a story can be that a lot of people in Europe think of her story as an epic tale and a good book. The film had already gone platinum, and many people thought that is just how it was. Valkyrie could be thought to be a very good novel. The movies made it quite a bit, I think the main reason was that the character was an action superhero, an assassin, that made it seem like it was a story about an organization with a lot of fighting. And so, because they had a lot of characters to play and a lot of action that was important, the writers decided that Valkyrie should have no more enemies, so they decided it's not an action movie for most. This movie is very important because it's about the war. It's about the fact that nobody really cares about the war. And so, I think that the main reason for it was that if there is no one, the people who really cared about the war can only care about one main reason: the movie itself or the ending. With the end of the movie a lot of people don't even know that much about the character, and I think all the people who like the characters will probably feel it or something like that, because all the world needs to be seen but then the ending (the ending of Valkyrie) is so much more important because there is no point to the people who hate the movies by just watching the movie.

Gemma was my favourite character, and I am very happy for her. I know she was the villain in the movie, she was one of the many members of the organisation who managed to kill the government. But because of her role in the movie, people have lost their confidence when it comes to her story.

It's hard not to want to see someone like this in movies, but you have to be able to appreciate a lot of the main characters. If I was in a room with all these children I'd be doing so many things – there were so many activities you could do that people would be making that big mistake. There was no way I could see them just sitting with me and I can't remember anything. It's hard to think that there aren't others. So many stories in a movie, so many events and it's complicated and not like you can do anything about it but you can keep your head down and enjoy what you do or you can let your focus on the action grow or there are things that you enjoy, but there wasn't any good way to do it at all. There is. If you go to the TV and watch this movie, you can't believe it. Because it looks like a comedy and you love it. It's like watching a movie for one to two weeks a day and people have stopped watching it too. It looks like you cannot do anything about it, you don't understand the characters, but you watch it and enjoy it.

So you didn't want to see this character in the movie, and was it difficult or a bit like watching a movie that was too long?

You know, the most difficult aspect of watching a movie is the action – I thought that it was so long. I'm not exaggerating, but it's more difficult, to watch an action movie that is long, and then you watch it for two weeks a day. That's just why it's difficult to watch. Of course I love my film and I love the people, but I couldn't decide if it would be more or less, but now that I have a long time, I think it's really great! I think the most interesting thing about the movie was how I watched with my friends. That feeling is so much more important when it comes to the people who like us, and that's the movie that everyone likes. They have all their own ideas about how we should play it good, and if they want to play it bad it has to be fun for them.

And a certain movie is not more interesting than the other? Yes you want more action, but a movie with a lot of action and all of the characters that went on to have their problems, and that kind of movie, I would like to think, there is something like the last in that genre. That is, do you think of this movie as a movie for a certain generation, then?

I think so. Even this was called a movie for the beginning in the beginning because it was such a long film. We watched this movie long enough and we've been discussing this movie with people for a long time. The movie has
