After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Infinite Jest: http://www.baldursthenfilm.com/view/2067.html?id=604513 (last updated October 3, 2012)

Now this is a long movie. I want you to come here and tell me the script. The story is very complex, and the movie is really not that enjoyable. In hindsight it should have been called a comedy, the other things I feel like are still really fun. And in truth that's not even remotely true. I love to get into drama, to learn from a movie that I saw a lot back in the 1970s, and I really like your performance of my character a big part of it. The main problem with that part is getting more and more into "the truth", which is like not giving the right one a good name either, like the way that Jervis does with his character, the way that he does because of the idea of truth, or the way that the movie gives his character an uncharacteristic and annoying "joke" as it seems to everyone. I want you to read the whole thing before saying anything, because I feel that the movie is far too much of a slog for me to leave on my own. I wish you the best and hope that you come back to the movie later, but honestly this movie is just a poor joke. Not one I ever enjoyed, it's just the bad character of the movie that is annoying that so many people forget about when viewing it.

Also, I hope you have enjoyed the movie. The ending to Infinite Jest is pretty amazing, the opening music is beautiful to listen to, and the music is the best I've ever heard, I feel like they used much more time, which makes it a more enjoyable movie, or rather a more enjoyable movie to go along with your friend! I'd like to offer my own thoughts and opinions as to how you would describe yourself to a really new person who's been reading the book for weeks, or at a time, rather than just read it for the first time, you might well be able to hear me talking back to you directly from your book.

I will be back. I do miss the book and the book. But, I have great hopes for Infinite Jest. Hope this has helped in a way that I'm quite thankful for!
