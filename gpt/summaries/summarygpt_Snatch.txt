"Don't do anything at home that would cause a problem if you were a boy of 13-15" (The Wizard of Oz, The Adventures of Nemo, A Christmas Story) –This movie is from the 90s series so is very funny about boy and girl. It also deals with a younger boy, where boy is the main character, that's it we are going to say this, the show ends at the 14th episode.

Like most movies, the dialogue is quite good and is interesting. It has a nice and engaging atmosphere and there is probably some things that people will not be able to hear out of this script or in this movie which are not available in the English versions.

There are some major plot gaps with the other two films that have come out for the first time, there is one minor scene at the end which changes from a really simple thing and is still good. It is interesting enough to watch that in an English episode we are able to see the end of the third chapter of the second TV version so you won't need to say anything about the first two chapters. The third chapter of the first TV version is more interesting and also adds some interesting drama which is also great at the start to end. The final story is very good. We have only seen two short and I would suggest you watch them if you are an English viewer.
