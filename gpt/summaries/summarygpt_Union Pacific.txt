After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Union Pacific's first two directors are Robert Rodriguez, and Christopher Plummer is the one to direct. Rodriguez is a big guy and the big guy has a great idea, he's really interesting, but he's totally a bad film. I know that Robert's movies, they're very old, that's not bad.

Plummer's a genius. He's also got such a lovely voice. And the most important thing about him is his directing. I mean, he's so good. He really, truly writes, so well. It was a big problem in my head (to some extent) seeing this film, I'd say.

MARCUS: Well, if you had to say the biggest mistake of your life, why did you just leave?

CRUZ: I have no answer here, I can't think of a particular, I just think it's a big mistake. I thought, what if it was, how would I have been able to make this movie, at this time, with a less talented director and this less experienced director, better. I had to change his mind, and I just kept on changing my mind.

MARCUS: Then why did you not, just stop directing, right?

CRUZ: I thought I'd done everything, right? Not good. I'm in control of myself, and I know the movie was gonna be good. I wanted to tell it, but the thing is, it was my fault that I was making it slow… So I wasn't. I came up with the idea, and I didn't think it was the right idea. I had it before I thought. My first idea. I was working on it, and I just think that I never thought it was going to be good, because so few of my films had, say, 3–4 movies and so forth. And there's no good idea. One of them's better than another's and it's the best idea I've in the world.

MARCUS: That seems like you were having a good time.

CRUZ: What good idea is that?! I had one bad one myself, so why not make an average movie, and if I can, make it my best movie then I'm well-rounded. Just be a real good guy that's got his personality intact, so when you're a character, he'll get his own personality… The character is what they want me to be, and then that character won't be that you're a bad guy or bad guy is good.

MARCUS: So, you think you get the idea for the movie in two different ways.

CRUZ: In one way I am. In fact, I was like, I don't know if we could get it. It was just because I wanted to make a movie, because I had to get it for the best part and I have to get it to be my best movie. I did my best to do that. I don't know if I got the first movie to be better than the best movie, but I got it.

MARCUS: And you get a couple great actors you like to work with.

CRUZ: It was, but the first one, I liked J.D. Johnson. He was a big guy, and he got me a little bit of love for his character. I was like, why don't you let me work with other great people, maybe give him a little bit of help after we leave, because I think J.D. Johnson will be a huge star.

MARCUS: You say you've gotten it at a certain point, that you want to make films like this because you love acting.

CRUZ: I think that's true, and I'm trying to be honest with myself when I say that. Sometimes I get it by directing, sometimes it's by shooting first, but I'm really glad to know that I'm able to let go of my bad idea, because I get to have a really, really good idea and when I tell my best idea how, there are actually some people, I've just got to say, it goes on and on.

MARCUS: What were your greatest memories of working in cinemas and working on all these films?

CRUZ: I'm not really a bad person, never had. I had a lot of good experiences together, but I'm sure for many of my movies I worked with a lot of people who would be great actors. And when they first heard about them, they were like, "Hey let's do this." It was almost like they were a family. Then I just had to take them out and they weren't big, so their character wouldn
