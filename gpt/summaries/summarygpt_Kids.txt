After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Kids in L.A. 1 has had no choice but to reassemble itself, and no matter the cost, I will give the movie 5 star or even better. That said, I will say that the movie isn't quite perfect, and I think it's not a film as good as I'd even expect it to be. There are times where the production quality is not quite right, even though it's still good enough to make most people question the wisdom of giving the movie a 5.
And, of course, there's the issue of the quality. The production is always terrible, with sound effects and CGI, the director never even acknowledges the soundtrack has any impact on the overall score. Sometimes I don't see it once, but I'll always call it a good movie.
So I'm here to tell you that this movie is a fun time filled horror comedy film (I think this is still at the base of the popularity of the movie) to not only enjoy, but also to hear all of the horror and horror elements of its original trailer. It's not so sad of a movie like you know, but also that the director and cast are very good, and with the right people and the right actors (and even better performances).
