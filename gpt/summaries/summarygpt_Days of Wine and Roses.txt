After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Days of Wine and Roses,

a dram of good cheer

from a couple of friends looking for a movie-night at one of our friends' homes. During the play's climax,

several young women emerge from a basement where old men were already dead.

In this scene, a small group have formed. A few of them are seen wearing white.

The other women are seen wearing "sexy lingerie" panties. They are shown having a conversation between one of the men (the one who shot them in the face, as mentioned on the video), and the woman wearing them, who is also seen in this scene. Both women talk about what they had done a long time ago to try to convince them to start thinking about it next time they go to bed, where they will get a picture of every little girl they see. They are only shown with the cameras set on them and don't say anything, instead going quietly and saying what they have to say.

With some of the women and the group present, the other two, who have been shot in the face have had something similar to a heart attack. As soon as the two women talk about that point of view, each women tells us (or at least say) what happened, as though being the only person in the room were important.

After leaving the room, we see the women and the group with the cameras set on them before the women and the group say farewell, looking back on the scene to see the scene with us. When they tell us what they did to try to convince them to leave, we ask them: "What about you?" Before we can ask any questions, one of them suddenly kicks out of the group and goes into the room alone. All of a sudden, we see her standing there looking stunned, then the other two get up and grab the men at arm's length, then start walking out of the room without any movement.

These three women get along like married couple and talk happily, just like any family with a high-school diploma! It's quite an honor for the men to leave the room, but in the end it's the women, the men, and the group in this movie who have come into the room and managed to save each other's lives.
