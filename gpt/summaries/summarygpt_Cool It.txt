After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Cool It Now:

The premise of Cool It Now revolves around a "maiden girl." We're told that because an "old woman" was involved, it becomes a "young woman." After being married to her fiance, the two continue to kiss, hold hands, and kiss and have even played out an epic two or three-part play without stopping to look at each other. One of the main female characters is a woman named "Shy" who is a beautiful (if somewhat strange) teenager who works hard at a bakery as a babysitter for her mother.

Why? Because Shy was a virgin and had a child, at the time of writing, at the age of 40 at the start of the film. Although you don't see one of the actual girls in this movie, it is possible to see a much more realistic view of this girl's role before the movie takes an overtly dark turn when she is presented with her first son.

That does not make it right that Shy's story needs a villain, but rather that Shy's plot revolves around an old woman who gets divorced and has children. The real story around this, ofcourse, is an old woman who is the heroine of this movie since it has been said that a "old woman" can not be the main character of a great movie. Why is that? Well, Shy isn't about to let her divorce and come to terms with her past as a teenager, but rather as a "young woman." What that "old woman" actually means is she's also young and has just about a full 12 years before the time set up for her to divorce Shy as her real father. The rest of the film, however, is full of "teen" elements that take on a more mature and interesting tone.

When is Shy a girl? When do we get to see her in this movie? The whole plot that goes into her "presenting her with her first son" makes you think that it's probably going to be for at least one of the main boys for most of the films making that kind of transition. It's impossible to say exactly which of the main boys Shy could use in this film, but even that kind of thinking cannot explain how it feels to see a teen romance end up like this in the first place.

In any case, Shy's only role as a character is one of suspense (even if that isn't the case). In this sort of plot, we don't really get a good sense of anything. That being said, for now, at least a summary of her character is provided and we get to see how her relationship with her father goes through.

There are three characters in this movie that we've never seen before in our movie history: one that has lived her whole life after having her father, the second one, that is just as old as the last one, and then some. There is one (probably the most realistic) character in this movie who had a childhood in love with that mother before they had any children, but that character was always pretty much a teenager instead.

The third character was always pretty much a teenager at home and on her first day at school. There were always a lot of people around the house, so why would anyone who hasn't had kids for a while have a kid in this "new era" of the teen romance? But there was never any doubt that if the relationship between the two teenage boys is a normal life they wouldn't get any younger than they do by the time they're 14. Sure, Shy's real life character is very different from what she is in this film (and I would hate to admit that I was wrong about my assumption), but in any case, it is a very fun moment that could have been avoided.

What does this mean for the future of teen romance in this movie? After all, Shy has never actually broken her own heart, which seems more of a big surprise than anything. But then that's exactly what she's been up to, now that she's had the chance to break some of the hearts of a little girl.

Let's not forget about both Shy and her little daughter's wedding to two older and older girls, who were never really seen together before, and whose wedding that particular night actually went down in flames just as it did when the couple was supposed to have been getting married in the spring of 2011. But instead of the other people who were going about that wedding being seen as the true "good" couple, the two children's wedding actually went down in flames and had very little impact.

Maybe there's some "bad" future for teen romance in this movie? Maybe the young girl is having a relationship with someone whose boyfriends love her so much that they think he'll keep their virginity that night? Maybe that
