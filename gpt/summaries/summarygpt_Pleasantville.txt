After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Pleasantville (2014). This is the first film I ever really felt as the person I cared about most. My life change, my happiness. I could not understand even the beginning or end of this movie other than for an instant I felt it. A little bit I lost my confidence in myself, and my friends. The movie does not give me much information about my life outside of this one. I felt like a little person, that's all. At this stage I think I can say that there is no other movie I have ever been to. Pleasantville is just another good movie.

There's so many other good movies around and it's all a short story. This movie is such a fun and interesting thing. This movie is the first ever animated movie and an excellent film to make. The movie is a dream come true that I got all excited about. It is also what most fantasy based movies seem to try to make me into. This movie is so very fun. I really want to watch this movie every time I fall in love with this world that is so wonderful. I want to watch this movie with every love for this world, always with the most love for beauty in every single form. And I am so happy about it.

I'm so thankful to everyone who has supported me and all my family during so many seasons of Pleasantville. I hope we stay in touch.
