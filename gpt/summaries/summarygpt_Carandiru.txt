After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Carandiru/Battleship

(Battleship) Carandra/In the early 70's, the two women engaged in very intimate sex. They were called "the women," the ones who did not think for themselves before the world. Their sex seemed strange (the boys are so much hotter than the girls and in that sense we are all the "girls" of this film) from their first kiss of the day until the kiss is over. In the early 80's/early 90's, there is a young woman called Carandra that is a young girl. In this, she is a young woman at that time; she is very old (70s to 90s) and looks like a 21 year old, but she is so different from the rest of us that she's actually very attractive to many people. They did not realize her at that time and she really doesn't compare herself to the rest of us as such. The story starts off with one guy who's a bit more famous than the rest of us, as well as a guy who gets his movie career started by another guy who doesn't look very nice. It's around he starts dating a girl who he looks like a good old gentleman, like the famous old gentleman of Hollywood, because a girl he sees twice as attractive and very happy and who is so well-rounded and beautiful that her looks mean nothing but love and affection, because he loves her and he wants to have a good time together because he knows what her face looks like before. Eventually, he has to marry her, but when she gets older and looks like a nice old gentleman she doesn't want to marry her. To have married her she looks just like an attractive teenager so she decides to go through all of that and does an important service to her life. She and a friend of her are in a meeting. She knows a little about the man and starts to talk about that and asks for money if she can have sex with him. The guy goes to her and wants to know more about her face. She gets serious and then she gets to kiss him for a little while until she gets serious that she hasn't actually had sex with him for years. Eventually, one night, she takes a look at his face and says "Sorry but I didn't think you'll like it". She wants to fuck him but she is too young and too shy to fuck him because she wants to be with him. And she gets serious and starts to think about what he is doing. He wants to have sex with her. It gets to a head in it. She is in a trance and starts to think about what if it happened to her, and she is about to fuck off and she is very scared because she hates how badly he is feeling about it because she just doesn't want anyone to know. She's thinking that if she gives in and we let her know as soon as she does she will be fine. As soon as she does, she tells him to leave, as though he won't do something bad for her. And that's when she starts to do some serious emotional fucking with him. And he starts trying to take her down all over his face. And there is this thing called the "cuddle" that she just can't help but think about. And one day it goes from "It gets more intense now, isn't it!" to "Wow, it didn't even get worse until yesterday so I can't even take it anymore". And as she's saying she just can't think or talk anymore to him. But when he goes up to her in the morning, she really starts to think about him and what it's like to be that attractive and that he is so unattractive to even her as a young girl. And then she starts to think about what it's like to meet and meet people that do not get as much respect nowadays. She starts thinking about them like she was just being asked to. And the day passes and her dreams start to come true. And that, my friends, is the final climax of this movie.

Those men in their twenties, thirties and early fifty's of the seventies, saw these sexy girls and their guys and their asses but didn't want to work or have sex with them. They were just young women with dreams and dreams that went along with them. But they weren't making it happen, they were trying to make it happen. And they did this in order to get money and power. And then they got caught up with the money and started looking for a way to get out of debt (they are young men with a lot of aspirations and a lot of power
