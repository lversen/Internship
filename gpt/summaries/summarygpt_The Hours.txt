After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Hours Of Wayne. It seems as if you are watching a movie with a "progressive" subject; you were trying to figure out what is the next step in what's supposed to be a well-written story. As the trailer to The Hours of Wayne says: "There's no excuse here. A lot in this story comes to us through the experiences of our parents through the loss that our grandparents once had, our grandparents we know through our grandparents' lives we know through the physical injuries they had. And that's not excuses, that's a story about what we've lost, a story about the human life that we might have had in that life that was so different from what we lived in." In his trailer to The Hours of Wayne, Wayne's mom was talking about how much she enjoyed the movie and her feelings so much of the movie is about her life, but also about his struggles with his father being the only white man in his life who ever seemed to have "real" love and support for people of color with whom he was very close. She has heard that he seems to live in a kind of "white" bubble with other people because he's such a big-bagger and he has not "realized he is a victim of racism." He also says that his relationship with his father did not last quite as long as the people in his life are told and they really feel threatened, not just because of their race, but because they don't want to have family members in the relationship. So if you get the idea of "this movie is about us being black, and my whole life was about being white," then look at this movie. It almost sounds like "Blackness doesn't have a negative connotations on anyone. And yet we live on a society in which people feel we must act in ways that are contrary to our own." At first, the implication of this movie being about us and our family is "black people are the victims, the same way you and me are being victims." Then there is a really big difference between being "Black like Wayne and "naturally white like Wayne," and being "Black like Wayne and the white he lost." So even though the film does include the lines like "We don't speak English, we don't understand English," then it actually feels like the film is about us and the fact that he can be black. If you want to go back to the moment of the TV interview where the father of the victim says he has never lost anyone because he is black because "We live on a society without people who look like that"—I want to leave it there. I want to go back to the father's line. I want to see her, because a lot of time we were being scared that for any child of color that is going to experience what is portrayed as "white racism" that he has never actually experienced racism. But even though he's trying to prove that he doesn't have a problem with people like that, that, even though he has lost his mom, he has "real black" feelings and experiences. As for the fact that "Black life is a burden" because of being black: In the movie, Wayne struggles with the idea that he is in some kind of limbo, and as he tries to prove it, he finds out that he really does have black feelings. In the movie, there is a black person's love for the white and a black person's love for other things. At one point he says, "These things aren't right," and is talking about how he wants to keep his relationships with the other people that he has. But they don't let him get close so he goes on: "Okay, I just want to keep things that I've been having with black people as separate as possible" and then he gives up: "I just want to do the things that I thought are right out." But as he goes through the things that he thinks are right out, that he wants to keep as his "black" "otherhood as he knows it" becomes the "black" that he wants the way his white "otherhood" becomes: He's going through so much stuff that he thinks that he cannot keep his black thoughts separate from it, even in the best possible way so that eventually he has to keep what he is being brought up to mean the way he is being brought up to mean. The fact that he does not have the "right" black thoughts becomes irrelevant because he is actually getting the whole thing he was trying to "convert back" into a white "otherhood that seems to be his own" and he has to be told, once he has this idea that he must keep all the words and behaviors, that's what's being hidden in his head, and that's how you cannot keep your black thoughts separate from that and your white black
