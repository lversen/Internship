After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Quiz Show: On the Night of 9/11, the 9/11 Commission found that the official theory was 'the truth,' and that the hijackers were simply people from another religion (Islam, Catholicism, Judaism) and that the World Trade Center was 'being constructed by two large companies, two big corporations. They were using the WTC for their own and have the same plans to demolish the buildings - so, with the aid of their government contractors, all of the buildings at the WTC were also constructed by two big corporations and designed with the terrorists in mind. I've made these predictions many times already, that the US Government was the target of a terrorist attack, that 9/11 was caused by the terrorists, that the US government was an imminent threat to mankind through its sponsorship of the terrorists, and that the attack would be stopped by the US Government, which would take away their ability to maintain the structure, for the US Government could have taken the 9/11 Commission's verdict on 9/11 and put it on the table."

The American Institute for Science and International Security's James Bamford tweeted a link to the documents the group released Thursday, and a short statement the group released late Thursday night:

Jihadist group called the 9/11 Commission, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Council for Foreign Relations are calling the commission and the US government responsible for 9/11/11 to be suspended

Statement from the American Institute in London: "The American institute for science and international security calls on the US government to stop its support of the 9/11 commission and its supporters in Britain, the US, and even the European Union - now in the hands of the terrorist group called Islamic State (ISIS) and the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). It is unacceptable that the 9/11 commission, chaired by the most hated figures in US government, Washington at home and abroad, is involved in promoting the so-called 'truth' as a cornerstone of a war-mongering foreign policy."
