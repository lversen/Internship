After this input give a synopsis of this movie: State of the Union to a Post-Secondation State, Part 1 at 9:54 PM ET, John Boehner, R-Ohio, called on Republicans to vote on an immigration bill that is "ambitious" and will help alleviate millions of undocumented immigrants from illegally residing in the United States.

The bill, Senate Bill 921, has already moved to the House.

The House approved the bill with a 53-49 vote in March 2015, and the Senate voted to reject it on Thursday.

At the debate, Boehner did not specify if Republicans should pass their immigration bill over to the House GOP, and House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told his leadership that there were no changes at the Senate floor to the original version before it passed.

Boehner offered that the bill will also address the massive number of unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States illegally while retaining the protections of the Bill of Rights.

"It is time the American people knew that an immigration bill that would protect our nation's most vulnerable immigrants is out of the reach of ordinary people or people that can't read the fine print," Boehner told reporters, adding there is an increasing chance the bill's "legislative prospects and the long-term costs will not diminish."

"And I think there are lots of Republicans on the other side of the aisle who want to do something about this," he said.

But according to sources with knowledge of the process behind the motion to reject the bill, only a handful of House GOP members made contact to say there would be no change, and then the final vote was stayed, resulting in the bill's passage.

It is one of several measures being considered by the Republicans' leadership to address the issue of the legalization of marijuana, as several House Republicans have suggested.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the proposal to end the legal age of 21 to possess marijuana was seen as a long-term solution to a key issue, not an option in the current economic climate.

After Boehner, Issa told journalists he has "no interest" in moving the bill forward. He was asked if there is any other group that Boehner could work with on what they can do to address the issue.

"There is a process to work with the House GOP, but right now, we have a process. There is something to be done in place that is in place for this," Issa said.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) called it both "a good idea" and noted it is a vote ahead of debate for the measure to pass.

"I see it as a positive sign that we're making progress, but it just isn't working as it was," he said on CBS's "Face The Nation," saying it was "the only way it has a chance to pass," but that it is "a short-term, long-term process."

Corker went on to say there is a "real hope here for the House to move the bill forward because there are a lot of hard working Republicans that want a better job," while acknowledging that it has "some challenges."

Republicans have in the past opposed a number of amendments to the bill, including a provision in the bill that would make people ineligible for welfare while still obtaining citizenship and several other amendments.

But it has been a rocky road for Congress and the House GOP, which led the majority to reject their push for legalizing marijuana outright, on social and economic issues.

Some lawmakers have sought to reverse the progress made under Obama administration rules that have allowed more undocumented immigrants to make legitimate legal U.S. residency in the United States.

House Republicans also led Senate consideration of a legalization bill for medical marijuana, a measure Obama approved.

The House passed a similar bill in 2013 and its version failed in the Democratic-controlled House. But Obama said in 2013 that after the drug was grown or sold legally, patients of the drug would be required to obtain a "limited list" of treatments that were "invasive to the health and welfare of the nation."
