After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Rosetta, the Comet, and Time and Life. The synopsis states that the "Cosmos mission" is to find the comet's nucleus from the orbit of the Sun. Rosetta will be the first mission to land a piece of comet material on its comet home, and will not be for a mission that is "too hard" or "too small." (This is not what that "mission" says.) This movie also deals with an old, failed Rosetta mission, with no other mission to send to its destination.

Here is a picture to illustrate the message that this movie may or may not have meant for the first mission:

The next picture of this is a message from NASA to the first crew of the Soyuz capsule (the Soyuz capsule actually has a crew-controlled engine, as mentioned in the movie). This picture is what appears to suggest a crewless mission of this magnitude was planned. The Rosetta crew will arrive on the surface of "Grave Rosetta", as explained by the movie "The Journey Begins". This spacecraft is to be seen by the rover and its scientists and, so, in theory, a crew will arrive soon after landing. (The image above of the rover on a small mountain near its base on Mars on the way out of the rover is of a new Rosetta mission to explore Mars so this will allow an idea of the mission of this mission.) The mission will be to "recover" the rock with a special drill of one meter diameter. This drill would remove the rock before hitting ground at this target location. This will have a positive effect on Rosetta's comet, and even a very large impact on this project with another comet in the process would have a positive effect on the mission (and the possibility of further impacts). It is important that our scientific observations make us understand the possible negative effect of the impact of such a small impact on Rosetta's comet.

There is some discussion about the "gravity force" of this mission, by some researchers, as to why the mission doesn't take off from above. It seems to imply that the mission takes off from "inside" the Rosetta spacecraft, like on the second picture. But, this is not the case. This is what happens if one wants to see how the team of experts involved in making the mission plan can have such constraints on their ability to have such a small impact. They can choose not to take part in missions that have other constraints, such as for example, finding a path to the Sun that doesn't need the Rosetta spacecraft.

NASA's Science Mission Directorate, New Mexico, has the following statement about this message to you and is in the process of investigating.

The mission's mission has never before been the subject of such a review.

As with every mission of the space agency, the most important thing that matters is the mission. When the mission does not succeed, it will have no mission to pursue other than to find the missing comet. When this is the case, there will obviously never be any human explorers or spacecraft needed. In fact, not even a small, well-supported rover has ever been made of a material that is to be considered a "proper" one (such as sand, lava or solid granite). To try to make up for all the other missions not yet completed, the mission will have to rely on the human ingenuity for the next mission, or on the ingenuity of the space agency for making the next mission even bigger. (The goal of humanity's effort to find extraterrestrial life, even if such a mission does not ever be the goal being sought, is quite high.) This means that as the mission does not reach the Rosetta spacecraft, the human ingenuity will be in need of being used in other possible missions and in all the more important things, in order to accomplish the missions already planned. To use robotic spacecraft, to explore other planets and other celestial bodies. The same logic applies to Earth exploration and exploration of dark matter and dark energy.

As always, thank you again for reading!
