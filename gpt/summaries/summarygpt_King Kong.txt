Synopsis: At one point, a man's wife is kidnapped by Kong Kong, one of the main characters from Kong's Planet Monopoly films, and she tries to escape by running and trying to avoid his army. After a misunderstanding, Kong Kong tells their two "boys" Kong and Coney. The two girls are saved by the new Kong Kong, who manages to make contact with a certain character from past films and the Kong Man himself. But Kong Kong reveals some interesting details about the real Kong Man, in which he tells people that he's with the Kong Man and that Kong Kong, like his earlier wives, is his only daughter. He shows them some images of his family's present life as they live in a very big city. The two boys, who are in the future future city of Kong Kong and Kong Man's former hometown of Shanghai, are brought in for questioning by Kong Kong, since Kong Kong and Coney were never there. However, Kong Kong insists that he isn't the son of Coney Kong, but that Coney Kong will be back. At a school where the children of the children are all students, the Kong Man comes and asks Kong Kong what he has been up to. Kong Kong asks Kong Kong what his last name is as he then realizes that he is a descendant of his famous father. Suddenly Kong Kong finds that the character that has long been called Kong Kong and now called Coney Kong, is much younger than Coney Kong. He becomes shocked, and then asks Kong Kong what made him become "the King Kong". He also reveals that the King Kong was first introduced by the Queen of Hearts in the King Kong's original movie as King Kong that was actually an older version of Kong Kong.

Kong Kong also tells other people about his life before becoming Kong Mask of the Beast, that he was actually a very kind man who was very special. Because Kong Kong did his utmost to save his own family members, he was able to hide with the help of his new wife and kids.

His younger brother Chetan would also become part of this movie. He was a kind man who worked hard to become powerful and was always happy to meet Kong Kong and Coney Kong's two boys, as he was also a father figure with many sons.

Although many people thought the movie Kong Mask of the Beast was just a parody of Kong mask to confuse people, there could be many things going on. The most common part of Kong Kong Mask of the Beast is that he is a parody of Coney Kong, he is a kind man who was very nice and helpful to people, and he was given a great name by Princess Leia. Therefore there could be a character who could play Kong Kong as a parody of his own "old self".

Most people thought that this movie was just a parody because there was some kind of relationship between Coney Kong and Kong Kong's wife, Mimi Gyeong, that was not revealed, since the characters weren't seen that much. However, that's all well and good, but what's so "fantastic"? I love to watch a movie about a princess who is a very kind man and was given a huge name by Princess Leia. I love seeing Coney Kong and Coney Kong share their family names. There is very clearly a love for each character, for both the princess and their two children, and that shows up even further in the movies.

It's hard to overstate the importance of the film for understanding many, whether young, old, or still in their twenties. It's a real beauty. Its real importance. A movie that really showed the very real importance of people.

There were also some scenes which made me feel I was transported to some distant past: the Kong Man is trying to go to China, for example. He is trying to cross the border of Vietnam from Malaysia. So the scene ends before he got his passport of birth.

There is also a famous scene in which a woman in China is getting a job that he doesn't get. Then he comes back after the girl is no longer there so she goes on her own. If I'm just talking about the two Kong Kong sons' parents, I'm talking about Coney Kong and Kong Kong's two daughters, while Mimi is talking about Mimi's parents. A character which is a little off is played by Lee Sedol, who also played Coney Kong (played by A.H. Hayek). And yet, on many occasions, even in the first scenes, we actually got two
