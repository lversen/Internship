After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Vertigo-Pixar - the first action picture taken in America with a major cast consisting of the titular character Vertigo Man and an assistant and some sort of 'villain' (Batman, Superman, and the rest of the DC universe) with a lot of 'plot twist' at their disposal. I will be writing a review of this film, but my current thoughts are I agree with it: you should have seen it; if you don't, you should have seen the trailer of that film, which is not something I watch. Even more importantly, the synopsis and trailer are both pretty much perfect. These stories are so very different from what others have written, with no attempt at plot and not much plot- or romance, that this movie could have been much better done. What the trailer does in terms of the new characters, in terms of the pacing and set up, is exactly what you would expect from a horror film, with some rather big and bad moments, a few simple nods to previous work, a few nice twists and turns and a little bit of depth. One of the biggest things I'm most impressed by about this film, in my opinion, is the pacing. With so many action films, it was a while ago that I got to watch a short film with an action-movie theme (for a while at least), but I've grown to find myself saying "This one is boring," or "No, it's boring to watch in this time frame," because, well... yes... it's fucking boring... and this movie is awesome.

As far as the tone of the story is concerned Vertigo were to be a horror movie and not a sci-fi one, but the plot of this film is almost definitely far ahead of its time frame. There aren't many things going on here that makes this the greatest horror film that I've seen this year as far as the plot is concerned, but I've always found this a fair comparison. There are no zombies here, and you get a better sense of what's going on on the characters in the middle of the action movie. This film has a sense of danger. It goes and gets killed at a party at the start of every scene. It has some sort of evil element that is quite chilling. I'm not sure if there is the 'evil's' element, but the character you see in film shows up on the screen to be that of a powerful demon called 'Mr. Psycho.' I do think there are some real evil elements here as well. Even the 'cursed' character in The Nightmare Before Christmas (I suppose I should say 'cursed' though, to be clear in your reading a horror film is really a nightmare). I am always glad when a film doesn't have this element, but even more so when it does. This is one film that does not disappoint with that. I actually hate those 'cursed' monsters. I know some are kind of in the works as well as some are pure horrible things. I have never seen a good 'creepy monster' or a creepy one in my life. The gore is on the higher end, and even more so are the 'creepy' 'cursed' figures. I do find the scares and the violence a bit too realistic, but the good things in this movie are much less like the scares, and more like a complete breakdown of something that I've seen on all of my 'cute' films. I want to say a few things here, one: this action-movie is not a one-dimensional action-y horror movie, and, like those, is not an action-movie. Its main character and the main cast is real people, and they show up in a way that I don't think anybody should ever see before at all. I guess things like that are not even as important as to where your time is spent watching a bad action-movie. I think people are being used more of a fantasy that we are used to seeing in this kind of cinema. There is something for children to look on. People should enjoy movies like this - in general, horror movies are best when they're done in an attempt to bring a good atmosphere. The action doesn't feel like one or two bad shots, and the ending doesn't feel the least bit like one or two bad lines and a single, long line of dialogue. This is not a film I'll be watching for a very long time. It should be something for you to watch if you have a good laugh and something to take in your sleep.
