After this input give a synopsis of this movie: My Fair Lady, Where The Hell Does God Go?? In the last scene of the documentary we see her trying to pull her car out of the ground. When she's done talking to you, she takes you to the entrance to the car, so we can look up at this amazing red car window. The driver says, "That's a picture. You saw this one, did you?" I get on top of her, and her face lights up. I feel bad for her because her whole frame feels like a piece of metal that's all about to explode and she's holding onto it like a pendulum as if to push off an object as she continues to move like a pendulum.

As with the other movies of the series, this guy is a bit over the top. He doesn't care about my family, I would rather get on this boat with him. But at least not on TV, because he is always getting more money. I've seen him so many times recently, and how happy I am to be at home, but he is absolutely in control and has no sense of humor or restraint. I hope that he will come back and be more of a cool guy and a funny guy as time goes on. But you won't find him in Hollywood anymore.

A short video I got from my friend Steve, which is his latest short: The God Delusion. I hope you can enjoy this piece and see what a wonderful character he is, how talented he is when we look back on what he had to do as an American citizen and how he came to be the voice of this country:

So I hope you enjoy listening to our interview with Bruce and he tells us about the film and the first four episodes and what you're going to miss at your part in bringing about a new, better life in America.
