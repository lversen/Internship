There may have been even some people who read this book instead, but it is a long and difficult read for many readers to keep up with its numerous pages. I've seen some of my fellow reviewers give it a solid 5 stars for being good for movie-goers, and some critics have even commented on it as being a movie for "old school" readers (more so). What I really liked about the movie is that, for all the good it makes the viewer who is curious for more, the movie shows in the final movie where, when the other characters are finally released to escape from a world in horrible circumstances, the viewer has the ability to keep seeing more "The Shining" for it to be understood.

This article is written for one year olds and includes information from around the internet, but is about as good as it gets in regards to my first review in a while, but I hope that you enjoy it and will have fun with the novel.

(By the way, I have only a few more review stories to go out of this book if you are a new reader of "The Shining")
