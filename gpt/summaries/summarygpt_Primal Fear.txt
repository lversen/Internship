After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Primal Fear is the first of many Star Wars films that also features the Jedi who became a part of the Galactic Senate in the year 20 BBY (approximately 25 BBY-25). After entering the office of Senate President Dooku, Kylo Ren (also known as Luke Skywalker, Bespin, Yoda and Amidala) and the other Jedi led by Dooku, a new batch of Jedi was sent. In the coming hours, the new Jedi joined the Jedi of the Republic. As a result of the Jedi's service to that country, many new Jedi became members of the New Republic, leading the New Republic to win the Galactic Republic. The new Jedi then formed the New Republic Government and created this new Galactic Alliance.[37]

One of those new Jedi was Anakin Skywalker (known as "The Red Jedi") whose past and present are shrouded in mystery following the murder of his master Han Solo, who was the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The red lightsaber from which this film is based that Luke Skywalker was cut from, was the second version the Rebellion used to replace the Jedi Council. The Jedi Council refused to accept that the Rebellion had any legitimacy (much to the chagrin of most of the Republic's citizens) in their dealings with the Sith and had instead chosen to end the Rebellion in order to create an Alliance by destroying the Sith and its people. Although this particular "red sword" was ultimately used in this film, it bears similarities to the weapon of the Knights of the Old Republic and the Battle of Endor in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. During the second campaign, several hundred Knights of the Old Republic soldiers who had fallen to the Sith army and who had received little to no training from the Sith Lord began participating in the Galactic Alliance in order to prove their war skills by defeating the newly created new Jedi and finally ending the Republic.[28] During one such battle between the Alliance and the Empire the Red Knights lost their position against the Republic while the Empire gained their victory.[29]

Several hundred additional dark side Jedi joined the New Republic Government following the death of their master (and eventual father) Luke Skywalker in A New Hope. Following the death of their master, Jedi students and staff members of that government attempted unsuccessfully to prevent another Jedi Lord named Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former Imperial soldier at the time, from becoming the new Emperor. One such student was the new Jedi Padawan Padmé Amidala (also known as "The Rebel Girl")[28] who tried for her life to become the new Duchess of Alderaan, claiming the promise of the throne the previous Jedi had made her promise to her in exchange for her promotion to the rank of First Consul. Amidala was later killed in the effort despite the attempt.[28] While the Jedi eventually became part of the New Republic as part of the Galactic Alliance, the Empire (both within the Republic and for various factions within the galaxy) still kept one representative on the newly created Department of Government. The new Secretary would later become Ambassador of the Republic to the Republic when the two nations decided on making a truce for peace and the restoration of peace. However, while she was present there, the Alliance was able to capture her and her child. The Emperor had a moment to decide whether or not to leave their former colony of Alderaan completely and return to Tatooine. During the exchange, Amidala stated that her friend was dead, but the Council did not like it and, instead, sent Amidala off to the Resistance and her children with Anakin and Tano, their oldest children,[28] to fight for their home world instead. At the last minute, the Council decided to cancel an agreement with the Alliance that they agreed to keep her on as the newly created Chancellor as she and Tano were being sent to the Resistance to serve Anakin in his mission of defeating the Resistance's forces and taking over the Empire's Death Star, thus leaving their world behind behind. Meanwhile, Amidala and Padmé were transferred to the Resistance, thus providing them with a chance to free their country and allow the people of Tatooine to return to their former home and to become citizens. While the Council decided that they now had some time to set up a new government, the new government was made up of the "Red Council," led by Yoda.[29]

The Republic and Empire later established a long alliance with the Empire so that both the "Red Council" and, more importantly, the newly formed Federal Government could finally be formed. After a brief standoff in the New Republic and an unexpected defeat on the part of the Empire for whom the new government would become the Republic, the New Republic and Empire agreed on the formation of their new government. Yoda's brother, Darth Vader, would lead their new government, and during the Galactic Civil War, two wars were
