After this input give a synopsis of this movie: World War Z: "The final battle, where the U.S., the U.K., our enemies, each have lost their lives and their lives are under threat. Our military, after all, is so powerful it makes its own rules…"

The movie takes place in a city in China. The country is in chaos, but the U.S. and the U.K. both rely heavily on the U.S.-China alliance. While a big part of China is involved, there are also factions that have a different plan of strategy. One faction has been trying to get to China, and the other faction is trying to get to America. The big danger is likely to be that the U.S. will eventually stop at China to defeat them.

It's all about the U.S.

This movie puts the U.S. in a very special role, perhaps especially since the movie took a significant turn in the U.S. presidential election last month. In his article for the Wall Street Journal, the British writer Stephen Ambrose, along with writer Thomas B. Anderson, describe in detail their experience leading a military mission against a dangerous foreign ally known as the Axis Powers.

They say that the U.S. is very closely involved in its role in the world trade, and has a big influence and political influence in the world economy. In many ways this is the same war, though this movie is much less serious. But in the end the war is important because it is the only way to win the world.

In a more recent story Ambrose explains why this conflict really matters:

As the war in Vietnam ended in 1962, "The War of Letters" introduced the U.S. to the world. It had its origin in the U.S., and the U.S. was not only interested in learning more than it ever had about the future of China. It wanted to make more of an impact on the international scene by publishing novels and other writings that were translated into English and were more critical of the Vietnam War and the Soviet invasion of China in the 1940s. As a result, the U.S. saw himself as a new internationalist force and was drawn in more in the direction of promoting international cooperation (whereas its military involvement led to the war). But that was not enough. It was too late and the U.S. lost its way.

The war was only one part in that long story. The movie also provides some great context from the early part of the book, including:

In the same movie, the world-famous French philosopher Paul Ricard, who wrote The Ethics And The History of Science (1760), says that the Great War with Russia is one of the four primary reasons for the wars that developed between the British and the U.S., not only because of the Western and Soviet countries, but because Americans were involved. He points out that while it's not clear that Americans didn't actually join in the war which started in July of 1954 on the border with France, France and its territories could have done so. And, it's true that Americans took the lead in the first place, and in the midst of the war came along the United States as well. However, as Ambrose explains:

[P]olice Carroti, in his essay The American Idea of War, has argued that no "real and immediate" American war was actually created from the first day on the frontier with Canada and France, when American leaders started to think out and think about how to solve the problems of the day — their foreign policy and those of other countries, their national governments — which were also the conditions that led to the formation of U.S. forces.

What's more, Carroti points back to the time when American power was a lot more important than it originally was. It was important that the U.S. learn the necessary skills to respond to foreign invasion from an American-oriented standpoint. And because it wasn't, the U.S. would not have done well against the Soviets.

So, while there are certain parallels in The Americans and Vietnam movies that can be drawn between the two, and The War of Letters is more of a story about war and diplomacy than most movies in this genre I really wouldn't call the U.S. in a negative light. It's too early to say that this movie comes close to the "American Revolution" as much as the "Great War" is, but there are a fair number of reasons why it's worth watching.

It's one thing to see the United States do everything possible to defeat the Soviet Union. But what about the people who are fighting in those countries to win that fight? For what does the U.S. have to gain against that force in
