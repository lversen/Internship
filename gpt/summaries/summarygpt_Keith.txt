After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Keith's Journey into Mystery of an Outer Space, and then later when Keith sees his life was transformed back to his former state which would bring him back to the real world. The first question on the first read of this movie is to where should Michael and Keith go from here, because this is an adventure movie, it's very difficult for Keith to actually connect with anybody that will ever live forever. The second question is where they should continue in life, because we aren't really supposed to ever know who they're going to love.

In the first story when Keith's mom goes back from her honeymoon he does a bit of searching with the boy which is kinda weird because he didn't get a chance to do the search for his best childhood friend until he's 17. Also, Keith's mom is being forced to marry for the first time in her life until her death. Not only that but she dies because she couldn't have kids for the past ten yrs and is now dying, with three children and the rest of her kids is the sole parent that she seems to have; the youngest one was born a year before her.

The third story tells me there is a lot of work yet and I think the movie should try for a break in, to come back after all: the previous story tells me there is nothing new because of the changes that the character of Keith is beginning to make during his journey into the world.

Now I hope the first part of this movie was meant to be a bit brief, like the last one. As mentioned before, the last one was about three decades after the beginning of the movie, so it'll be really hard for Keith to find the most exciting parts, but even at 17 he keeps looking through time. For Keith has his own journey to find some new life for himself and his family, but also his parents, who have always been very important to him and are very loyal to him.

When you play these characters you are going through time. So you have to do things and to learn things from your past experiences, and your experiences with things you will grow and get. You can't always be the best at that. But I think my hope on this movie was that it is fun to have this character grow into the thing where he lives, that he can become the thing he loves, the thing it would take on to make him more normal, more normal.

Starring is a small part in the story, though of course it's not a central part. If you really want to hear about the first part and see through an event, listen to what Keith says and watch it before reading the rest.
