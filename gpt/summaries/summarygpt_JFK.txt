After this input give a synopsis of this movie: JFK Assassination is the first and most complex film from The Shining. Written by Mike Murphy, directed by Frank Stambaugh, and written by Paul Blur and David M. Friedman, a riveting adventure into the life of Frank and his new wife Elaine and their lives as a teenager and, as the film progresses, takes on the world of JFK. (This movie is an adaptation of the best-selling 1964 novel of the same name, by The Shining writer Robert D. Eales.)

There are many sequels, with most of them based upon the works of JK Rowling. The most recent "Harry Potter" book was also based on Rowling's own work and The Shining's own story.

But, I still think The Shining can be a pretty good one. I'm not sure if it's worth $100 million or $1 billion to make. But it was, as the book and other material suggests, pretty good. (The story itself is a bit more developed than the story in The Shining, so the numbers are far better.)

The movie also contains interesting, well-executed, and sometimes even hilarious performances. (I know that sounds a bit like the film itself, but I'm not sure how good that is.) Also, the story, the movie-within-a-movie approach, is pretty enjoyable, and I found myself not feeling cheated for a while, but I do want to say that the movie, both in terms of pacing and cinematography, has taken some very good turns. (Even though, it just happens to be one of the best, funniest and even silliest movies for about the first 10 minutes.)

Speaking of pacing, The Shining has no real "magic formula" for getting you into a moment in the movie. You're given three "short" movies, and one of them can be a bit of a mystery. That has been a very difficult thing to do for me in my career, but I thought the Shining was a much more pleasant experience than something like "The Walking Dead." In fact, it was quite fun on its own. I would tell a person that "The Shining" feels like a movie with just one good and long shot. The way that it begins to be felt in "Harry Potter" or even "The Hunger Games" has a significant amount of momentum that I don't find in movies generally.

The film really needs to stand on its own two feet, and the pacing isn't quite there yet, but on that front it's strong.

The Shining is more of a story/movie than a movie, and I could enjoy it in a very different way. I still could enjoy it better if the movie's pacing was more interesting to me.

If you're feeling something out, the movies and the stories are interesting for you. That said, I'm not convinced the movie will be great. I might enjoy it more for the different things there are about the book being good, more for the plot being okay, more for the characters being good, more for the atmosphere being bad and more for the tension going the wrong way. But if you want more action, you should watch The Shining. I want the movie to be a lot more fun, and I really just didn't like the book. I like the books, my wife loves the stories, and I like the characters. But The Shining is what I'd want to watch for a movie that plays off its own strengths and maybe a bit as a follow-up to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." I'd definitely like that.

So just like any other book I've read, I'm not sure that I'll be able to enjoy The Shining more. But we'll be here forever, and when we do, I know that I could have a better life.

Love,
