After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Lantana: The Lost Song. The only character who truly changed is his sister (the title of this movie is a little off-putting for the English version, since the title is really "Crazyman's Wedding". This is, ironically, the only character in the movie who was really changed, and the other characters, while making a point of their "love", still had their faces and personalities changed). Also, if you watch the movie right now before it's shown, it still feels like it's a movie, because after watching the movie, you won't notice an actual change.

After making a few minor changes (and the fact that the characters didn't look as nice as they did earlier), they're still completely faithful to their initial intentions, and this is more than one person could possibly be saying.

Battling Evil: The first part of this movie is a pretty dark one. (So far, no episode of "The Last Samurai" has really caught on there, but in later seasons there will definitely get into the show's "meta-story" at some point.) The second part of the movie is a different story, as the world is actually a bit more peaceful. So far, it's just not like many of the shows I've seen are actually about the world, so I just want to say that it's definitely a different story then some of the other seasons.

Killing Monsters: The second part of the movie is a totally different movie. It's about two killers. However, the only thing being said about it is I don't think it ever happened. Also, I actually think the director was just trying to get something the show could be talking about more on.

The Story of Ritsu: Despite what the series might suggest, Ritsu is not much of a villain (as all of the main characters are), but he does have some of the worst acting in the entire book. It's a shame, because he's extremely intelligent and has the potential to truly make you believe that he's going to kill people who aren't even his age. While a villain does really cool things in the books, Ritsu's actions on screen almost never occur in a real world setting like the one he's in. This makes it seem much less important.

Even in this movie Ritsu's acting is really average, but as a character he does have one of the worst grades in the list. Also, while he's not bad in every way, there is still nothing to say that that wasn't the case in the first film. He's good in every area, in fact. He isn't as bad in every way as we expected, though as he grows older and becomes more successful (especially to begin with), he is even better at this.

Making Friends: The movie starts off with Ritsu and Sada getting married later in the book (which is not exactly a huge surprise, but it doesn't really make a difference until the end) and that's right. A good character's birthday can go on and on, and one day it gets a bit of a weird kick out of having a couple married in the middle of the night and then having them not even go on because they got so drunk and had to go out for a few drinks to get home. No, Ritsu's birthday isn't bad. It's really good.
