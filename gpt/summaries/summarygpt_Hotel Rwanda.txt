After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Hotel Rwanda-The first scene is a sequence wherein a group of young people in a small town decide for themselves which village is their favorite in real life (and that of their friends and family at a nearby resort). With the help of another woman who wants to share her passion for women in the city, the group of young men in question make a choice. What they are surprised to find out is that one of them ends up taking the decision for himself over the other one on the advice of another young man. In their initial encounter they end up having a rather awkward time making love, and once this happens the two of them grow even more awkward, until a fight ensues.
