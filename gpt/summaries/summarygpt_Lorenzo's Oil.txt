After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Lorenzo's Oil Rush to the Edge, that it will have a great amount of tension to the ending (which you should read), but it will only have a very casual feel to it and for the most part no real suspense. At least on its own. It comes back in very late stages of development and may not arrive next year.
