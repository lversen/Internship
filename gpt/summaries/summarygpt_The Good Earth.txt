After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Good Earth:

Director : John Landau

The original script by John Landau. I had a lot of fun, especially reading the script on youtube. So, for the record, I love all the new dialogue that I read and this movie is very different. If you have a friend who likes reading about the different lives in a very modern time period, especially those that are currently living in North America you can watch this movie. I think the world is so different now that it is just a couple people. But there is still a lot at stake, that we are trying to win now. We have to make this movie. That's it. I will tell you how important this film is. I think at the end of the day you can't help but look at a story that has been told and what comes out when you see such great things. I can't wait to see what's next.

I can't wait for you to listen to this. If you do, the first post (after you start watching the movie) has already been watched over 2,000 times, so I would appreciate your help in finding the next 1,000th in this series of posts.
