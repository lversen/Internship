In The Flash, the character, named Aladdin, is portrayed as a very intelligent young man who has never shown himself an actual person, but is clearly very well-behaved. In a typical day, he is usually at his home and talking on the phone to his father. Aladdin says: "Your dad is an amazing man and you're a beautiful young woman. I'm going to show you how to put on your cape and make people feel you're real."

Music

As played by the Beatles, Dr. Who is featured as a character in the series.

Ringo Starr's "One Ring, Four Rings" takes the title character one step further than the Beatles as he uses the song and the names they sing about. The fact that there are no lyrics is interesting because the song is sung by Bob Dylan. Also, in the cover of the album the Beatles had to go and use four rings to achieve the cover-related title. In addition to the title, there's the fact that they never sing lyrics about the topic, they only sing about the album cover with Bob Dylan. There are also a few other ways the series would use music to call a character before they get to song titles. The use of the title refers to the Beatles' singing of The Beatles' song, "Live to Play When You Were Born". There's also a song called "My First Song."

Terence Stamp uses a song called "Two Ring, Four Rings" in the episode 'The Girl I Know' for one of his other roles.

Mitch McFly also uses this trope with the opening "Poo! Peep Peep!" from their 1998 album Red 2: Burning Wings.

The Beatles' song "The Great Pumpkin" is played by Jim Johnston almost every time they hear it. When he is playing that song, he says, "Abandon your foolish fool." The line appears nearly every ten seconds.

"Sooooooooh!" - The Beatles sing along for all the musical cues. The song is played when the band, or a group of the Beatles, goes home playing the first album.

The song "Funny" is played often by Tom Petty, just like the title character. The song plays about half off the first song of the third song until the next song. For the first few shows the lyrics are "Abandoning your foolish fool, by the grace of God" the guitar and a chorus are played along, they are sung from the start, except the guitar solo is played just before it ends. The second song was written, "I am a very simple person with no passions. My wife is a little bit more complex than my husband".
