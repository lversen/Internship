After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Searchers is the story of an ex-con attempting to recover his parents' body, but in the hopes of getting to the bottom of their past. The script's director, Brian Hales, has a knack of weaving characters and narrative ideas with the natural and uncanny. Hales, whose name is also popular in the film making community, is a master film-maker and it's probably safe to say he's been watching his films quite a bit over the last few weeks.

In the final scene we get a glimpse inside the man's mind, which was revealed in the final scene where he's captured and killed in front of the camera, just as it was in the final scene in "I was Waiting for You." And this time our eyes are not on the man, but instead on the shadows and the white-tiled walls of the film-makers workshop, where he was living. (He's been dead for eight years now as a result of an illegal operation that was carried out by other members of his family.) We start to think about where and when one of these people moved, but our focus begins immediately upon the scene. "This" scene is a shot from the film-makers' workshop. We've already seen people being interrogated, and we've seen images of some of those people, and the film makers say, "Okay, we're in this room. We're looking for these people. We're looking for these bodies. And they're very, very hard to find. We've been through that in the past, because these bodies we went through got found just on the way. We didn't want to come face to face with that." The director continues, "These people, it's hard to find."

The final two minutes of the film are also a glimpse into Hales' ability to create characters and locations that could be a source of inspiration for future projects. He shows us a video from this workshop he filmed in late 2009. The director's face is the final silhouette of a man lying in front of a wall that, when looked at by the camera, reveals the killer's hand and arm. "The hand and arm that you see is almost perfect," writes the director.

And then is a shot as we move into the filming room. There are several people, the man with the knife, who are in front of a large crowd of onlookers. It happens to be the middle of the day, but there is literally no daylight. With the lights on, it's not just that the man's face looks more like a black guy than the person is. At this point, we can think of no way outside — only the fact that the light on shows something is off. We're in this room in the middle of a crowd, in a corner. It is a very close place, and you're looking at people. We are inside. We don't know whom to turn to for any good, or for no good at all, but it could just be a moment and a moment we can control. We will keep looking for things we can capture; we will remain silent and stay out of trouble. "This" scene is a shot from the movie-makers' workshop.

Hales says that he doesn't want to spoil this scene because the scene and the filming scene are very similar in almost all respects (the shot in the middle is pretty close together, and the shot in the middle is closer together). He then goes on to say that he uses light sources, especially dark colored light, so there's a lot of darkness in there, but it is hard to go down there. While the man is speaking to the police, an electric cord is in motion within the room.

And then there's a short shot on the other side of the room. A woman, holding a knife in her hands, sees people hanging from a high wall. The director and actors walk through the room just as she's getting up. It's as if she is following the scenes of the movie, trying to get through it. There are people on the other side of the room. When it's their turn, an electric cord is drawn. In the movie, she gets involved in a fight between two people, then is told by one of the actors that he needs to bring his family. But the actors in that moment don't get the chance to take a photo of her. The shot of the other arm is also very sharp and clear in light. It shows that there is some kind of confrontation, and that as a result there's an opening and a closing that shows a lot that's going on behind the scenes (about Hales), but it shows that the scene has a strong foundation.

He then cuts to the last shot of that footage in the story, which is a shot of Searchers
