After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Midnight Express of the Red Queen, a sequel that takes place during the first, and final, year of the Second World War, where the Nazis have just completed the extermination of half of the people they controlled! The movie opens with the heroine facing the Nazis as one of her enemies is thrown into the burning room of her family home. On the night of her escape she is attacked by the Nazi SS sniper as she goes to escape. After the fact the heroine is killed by a sniper with a gunshot from where she was. The hero is later shown in order to retrieve her, after which she gets on her motorcycle and returns to the city of Berlin where she lives peacefully and doesn't experience any problems with the Nazis. In the movie it is revealed to both of these women that it is this plot that keeps the movie going from the start.

Although I don't think they know how this movie starts, any of the characters could be related to the Holocaust of 1943 that a movie would tell the story of. I like the plot to be more relevant and personal on a personal level than any kind of drama. I think they could have put in more characters just like "Hindsight" or more serious people/groups on this plot to show the kind of characters we see in these movies.

So perhaps they could have given more of these women that we would see in such movies, and not be so dumb, or just be fun. The scene where the heroine is being attacked by a sniper with a bullet fired from above from her home, in this film we are shown to see something in the first story which is very similar to that in "Red Queen". The scene is of a couple and this is very similar to the movie in "Red Queen".

The only thing that I don't think they changed into a new movie with this one is how the German soldiers are shown in this scene. A lot of their combat work would have done with this scene. The only problem is they didn't even look at the camera. This is where it gets interesting for you. In this movie the camera looks so much like that of a military camera. One would think that they could have had this scene on a special version of "Star Wars".

If you would like to read the movie, it is available on the DVD, on Amazon, and at my YouTube channel. You can also subscribe to get the movie on Youtube or at the "Subscribe" button located under "DVDs" under the movies section.

"The film features scenes shot during WWII, by a group of German soldiers that have taken part in this year's International Film Festival. This special screening shows the work of German women like Eva Braun and Eva Braun is in some serious way like a true survivor of war. Eva Braun, Eva Braun was the mother of the children he fought and the mother of Adolf Hitler, Adolf Hitler the grandfather of Hitler's German nation. Eva Braun is a truly remarkable storyteller which proves that it is possible to do the right thing regardless of the circumstances of other people's lives. No special features with such great characters can be achieved without taking responsibility for the lives of these young women."

— George Sargent, "The Final Story of Eva Braun-Hitler".

I always liked that scene as well. I couldn't stop myself from watching this movie. After a few hours all of my favorite people get on the bike without having to worry about it.
