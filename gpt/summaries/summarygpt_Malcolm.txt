After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Malcolm Reynolds plays the former President and the former CIA officer-a veteran of many CIA-secret missions that helped expose the Kennedy assassination. The movie gives us a more complete look at the Kennedy assassination and its aftermath.

I love the art. It's hard to be a professional actor when you are not able to do what you love. It gets me excited to show my work and also to be able to go through any kind of bad feelings.

Do you have theories on a possible role for Robert F. Kennedy in The Untold Story?

I don't have any idea where to start. I would like to think that some future Star Trek films will attempt to portray his actions in a more complete and more accurate way. My favorite version of the movie is the final movie with his father and former head of CIA, William P. Kennedy. He does a lot of stuff (like keeping a spy story secret). I haven't really seen the actual movie but it is great that he is still alive. In fact, I can't wait until he is back!

What did you think when shooting the role? Do any of those possibilities ring true?

I love this character. She plays a bit like Robert F. Kennedy at this, but she is bigger, stronger, and smarter. I hope he is more than that but this is about her being able to get on a plane from her own home to the world of The Untold because of her connections to Robert F. Kennedy. After that, my love affair with George W. and his involvement in the Kennedy assassination has always been really strong as well. In that version, the film shows him getting on a plane while Kennedy is trying to get on a plane to Washington, D.C., all while he is working with a top aide.

You have talked about that a lot. Was that something you wanted to do to make yourself more recognizable, if not more important to the script?

Yes. So I went to the library at Columbia University to see what I had in my own handwriting. I knew that this story was about that and had the ability to draw a drawing out of my handwriting (which would be fine, it would have been even better without the pencil). And it worked so well, the best part was that I could also express the writing process just by touching paper. I thought writing was more creative, but I felt very much at home in using the handwriting, and it wasn't just my handwriting which was making the cut. The way I worked around the edges really made it so much more complicated, and I found the writing to really help me write better.

Do you get to go on various missions over your career? I do?

Yes. In many ways, I think that The Untold Story gives me much more of a voice in terms of what I can say. Of course the movies that are released after The Untold Story have also given me the opportunity to do interviews and see new things. My favorite part, having these great actors (Jenny O'Halloran, Bob Paltrow) and scenes from the movie, where they show the story like he does in The Untold Story is always fun because he makes one man look cool and the other look silly and he makes the movie look real. I also enjoy some scenes that the actors have shot at other people that I have met while in the film or the time on the set (when Jackie is walking back to the hotel, they shot this shot during one such trip!). There are a lot of different things that will definitely get a new audience. Sometimes the actors actually live on the set or the actors from one side of the set will meet for lunch. I am a little nervous I would be in one situation making a big movie (even though I love movies so much that I can say I feel like I am a writer writing a screenplay as opposed to in the original), but there are many times when a new actor has to act a little more.

What's next?

It is very important to me to get back to writing and to enjoy what I wrote the first time I saw the movie. I am looking forward to the next two films. They look awesome.

And as we always say in our reviews, if you have read our first article, then it would mean a lot to you if you bought the first one. And with that said, I hope you enjoyed them both. Let us know in the comments where we read other reviews you came by in the meantime and how you like them.
