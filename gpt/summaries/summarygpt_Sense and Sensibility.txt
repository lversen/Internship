After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Sense and Sensibility and then on to the finished film.

(1) The character of the movie is described in a way analogous to that of the original characters: there were no direct characters to write, but there were two: Edward Scuderi's character, which was the original protagonist's, and Joseph Fiennes' character, which acted in such a way that Fiennes only started writing in 1973. I will try to follow up with the rest of the descriptions, especially when you go directly from Scuderi's original story to Fiennes'. It will help to have a look at the character's life prior to writing, so it follows a basic template. The basic elements of my character's life can be found in my book; however, my goal is to be precise, because I try to follow a basic template only once or twice, so as to make it more comprehensible for people.

(2) The characters' lives are based on their experiences during their childhoods: they have memories of their childhood and adolescence, from that of a child who was never at their parents' home when they were children; then they have memories of their final childhood.

If you want to learn more about what each piece's personal lives might be like, look for "Rudolfo Visconti" (1979) in the title of a short, short movie called "Mud, Mud and Sand." It's not just about seeing the world, but about understanding the human condition. The movie opens with "Mud, Mud and Sand" that was written by the late Argentine author Andre Imanelli in 1946. According to Visconti, the movie was written at the age of 16.

(3) Some of the characters were filmed as children: in "Mud, Mud and Sand" the young Edward Scuderi tries to stop a "mud man" from doing what he wants in the forest. In an earlier work, "Mud, Mud and Sand", Richard Mepham's film, "The Wizard of Oz," the real name Edward Scuderi, is said to have been born between 13 and 17. This movie was based on the story of the first human to escape from the underworld. (Lily Allen, "Lily Allen of Bitter Rock: Two American Children's Stories," Time Magazine, August 1978).

In contrast, there are other films where the same story has a second stage stage. The first is "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes." This film was one of the first examples in which a child tries to do things that he does out of spite (e.g., buy candy for the boy's school). This second film of Scuderi's was titled "Closer to Christmas" (1970), "Closer to Christmas" with a little girl from Japan. This was followed by another of Scuderi's films titled "The Jungle Book." The first, to me, illustrates how things could have been better in the "Mud, Mud and Sand" movie.

Some of my film comparisons are:

(1) The movie takes place at the time a family was being attacked by an evil giant. This movie opens with the story of the attack by a young man who was never there. The son of the father was one of the young men, and they fled without much news of the attack. The family was going back home to Mexico, where they were attacked, and I think that it's fairly clear in the movie how the "mammalian war" was going. But the first stage of this first film was not a large fight, but a big explosion. (James T. Walker Sr., "The Mammalian War of 1973," Time Magazine, September 1975). It's interesting that "Mud, Mud and Sand" is also called "Mud, Mud and Sand" because of its similarity to the movie from the 1970s.

(2) The movie began in Mexico City at 11:00 (time), as the city was being bombed for days after the war. Here's Scuderi's description when the city was bombed: "At 11:00 the city was bombed after the war, but in retrospect it was very peaceful. When it was bombed the fire was very heavy and the air conditioner blew out after the initial explosion." The American movie was set in a city where many people could watch the same news but at the center stage of the war. I can't think of any other version of this movie that does that.

The first movie in the series, "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," has the same name as the movie in "The Jungle Book" since it was first made five years later. But I could have written it as "Deja Mura
