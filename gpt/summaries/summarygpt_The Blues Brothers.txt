After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Blues Brothers 2: The Good Side of Movies (1964).

The problem is that this synopsis for "One Night in America" isn't complete enough for many of us who actually watched it and didn't read it (like we do on Wikipedia or the BBC Guide Book). The movie could well have been shorter if the writers had chosen a more realistic vision of the American frontier and explored the challenges of survival. That is to say, there were still dangers at play so the writer had to make a choice: Is the American frontier a desert or a city in which the men and women in all three movies should move at some point soon enough to reach a place on their way back home. To this end, the synopsis was a great opportunity for the writer and a very important opportunity for the director.

The other part that gives the writer and director of "One Night in America" a major inspiration was the story "Dale and Sarah's Dad," a short story entitled "Why We Should Be Leaving Home Without a Child (1981)." The story is, of course, about two young brothers named Alan (Ariel Levy) and Jack (James Franco), who become involved in a war of independence for the U.S. The brothers return to the land of their birth, in a big city in what was then New Mexico, when the U.S. Forces at First Battle (JFK) attacked in 1946 and the U.S. Army took over power. In reality, it was their father's military service that got Jack a better look at American frontier warfare.

The writer writes: "The war in the Great Depression came to an end after some American troops had been killed, and the country recovered. After this military effort failed for quite a while, the new government was elected: President Roosevelt and his family fled after a bloody four and a half years in office [and] it got under way to begin a war for the country's future. A year ago, on August 23, 1931, the great American flag was lowered in the White House to honor the first Americans in American Revolution."

As I read the synopsis, I was struck by what I noticed. It has a kind of "punchy, rough prose": the characters are very much up to no good and the plot is largely based upon assumptions and stereotypes set by the American ruling class. It also has quite an odd and amusing scene where Jack, on returning from a visit to a small town in the wilderness of Montana and realizing the world and our collective history is still a place of death and destruction, is killed by a mysterious masked man (Johnny de la Renta, as he was known).

While I don't agree with the author and I do agree that it is a tough character to write, I do not think it is much better. And I think the story is so flawed and so utterly bizarre that I will have to rewrite and remake the rest of the synopsis below without getting upset. Either way, it's a pretty good movie at giving us some sort of insight into the American future.

"One Night in America" is a very good flick, and one that will make even those who haven't watched one in years excited.

A few tips to anyone who might be looking into that: Don't forget that the story comes out of nowhere and, as the writers for the movie put it: "We want this film to happen because it tells the American future and American history. That's the story, that's the show, that's who we are. The movie won't play out as planned, but will continue to tell the American story to people born here and here and here. And hopefully, if the movie is good, this movie will become an example to other westerns to follow."
