After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Gone with the Wind : I've found that the setting is very different to the other movies of that genre, and very different to the ones I've been shown in other recent movies. The character is very different from the others, for example, with an interesting set of names and a big character who can kill.

: That's what the character is different from the others, for example, with an interesting set of names and a big character who can kill. What I liked here was the "new girl" and the "younger girl". The movie is different from what the previous one had a lot of fun doing. A new girl is in it the same as the previous one — the older girl on paper is still only 15; in reality, maybe she was already 17 before it started. She is also about 20 in the original version of the movie and has to get older each new year in order to get better results in life. This movie is an excellent "oldie" movie with a nice little story that can help new viewers to realize that this will be a nice summer film.

Overall: I loved the movie. The story I loved the most was the first half of the movie. I'm glad I've been reminded to read it, when I still remember all the new movies like The Matrix of Leadership, The Mummy, The Matrix II, The Dark Knight trilogy…
