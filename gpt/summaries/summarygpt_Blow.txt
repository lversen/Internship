After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Blow to the Head. "I'm going to kill you!" The movie opens with the story of Bruce Wayne and the Joker, who has come to the conclusion that even though Batman is good people, he's just no good enough. It is not a matter of whether he's good or not, it's which role he's played. The Joker is the kind of person that doesn't make any compromises. The villain is the kind of person who goes by "Bad Cop". And it isn't just the villains that change these guys. There have been a few who go by their real names or have moved, but those are outliers, and I'd like to note that I find this movie really great-and it would have been fun to see where some of the movie may fall, but its in the right place. The pacing and characters of this movie are superb, and its story takes the viewer back up from where they started, and it's all the more entertaining if you watch it with a watchful eye. This movie is a truly special one-day film.

Rated 5 out of 5 by MrHV from Beautiful movie. This movie was one of my favorite movies of the Summer of 2012. I can still see the great films of the time coming, even if the film was slightly shortened... This movie was one of my favorite movies of the Summer of 2012. I can still see the great films of the time coming, even if the film was slightly shortened. It had enough laughs for me to watch it for the whole weekend. The characters are just great, the movie was good enough when it came to being on the road for me, and now I want to watch the rest of them. A couple of things kept coming up with this movie: 1) it was one of his favorite movies, 2) it had the most to say of the 3 movies, and 3) it was one of the first movies that I could watch as much on my schedule as I possibly could. If you like comedies and stuff about superheroes, this is your movie for you.

Rated 5 out of 5 by TheThrone4 from My first movie with these guys I finally got to watch the action movie of John Wayne! I was disappointed with the film and I didn't understand what this movie wasn't. My first movie with these guys I finally got to watch the action movie of John Wayne!
