After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Adventures of Robin Hood (1974). In the first movie, we learn the identity of Robin Hood (David Foster Wallace), when all of his family and friends are imprisoned and brought to the United States by some evil alien force. The villains are all men and they have been created by various people from different cultures including Bruce Wayne (Richard Howard) and Robin (Bruce Wayne). They all have different skills and abilities and have different backgrounds and things which make them different because they belong to different cultures on Earth.
The movie is told in this way because it is told in part by the original version and is made up of much of what was presented in the original English Language version of the original novel and story. In the sequel the story has re-written everything about the original story to fit the different versions.
Many of the main character of the story are introduced as they are re-formed in the storyline and created a character profile that is identical from beginning to end including their gender and any sex in general. The only differences are the name of the alien and that they are all male. The aliens were created by the British government in order to help them to defeat the evil alien Empire. When they were released there was a military campaign to stop that from happening, and there, they are now fighting an alien civilization trying to take over their planet.
Robin Hood the Original English Language Version has had a much more varied and interesting story but now it has been expanded on several levels. The American version has had a full cast of actors as well and there is much more to follow, but the original book contains plenty of more interesting aspects of this book like a new look at the past history of the two cultures.
The English version has been altered a lot in order to match the current story. This means the American version contains many of the elements that we expect of the new English Language books as well as many of the parts that we could expect from the English Language novel.
My review of The Adventures of Robin Hood is mostly done using Google Docs and is very thorough. However, as a matter of my personal taste I like that the original English Language novels are much more well written. I enjoy the original novels but the English version contains more material. If you have problems you can always request a free review.
I had not read The Adventures of Robin Hood prior to the retelling and I am not sure if I will return after this review. For anyone wondering how many times it has been repeated or if this review was even done, don't worry. Read it and be patient! Thanks for reading!
