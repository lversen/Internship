After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Black Stallion of The Land of a Thousand Thousand Men, by John C. Reilly

Plot: Heading for his wedding, Jack discovers that his wife is having a hard time finding her feet and that he is actually a thief on another city's side. He then finds a mysterious man who has helped him hide from the Black Stallion. Jack immediately begins questioning him about his marriage to the Black Stallion who have been chasing his wife for years.

After getting away from him, Black Stallion arrives and brings him home. In celebration, Jack and Jack's four young children visit him to celebrate the reunion. The little boy, Jack's sister, meets him at the bar of his home. He tells them that if they look hard enough they can come back and get some fresh water. The son tells them about his childhood in an orphanage in Mexico and how everything his parents would do in his life changed after his father had been killed.

Jack explains to the kids that all of America's laws have changed and, unlike his father, they're not bound by laws on immigration and are free to work in cities they want. The children show appreciation for his understanding and tell their mom that he's "the only one not stupid enough to have a problem with that." After that, they go to meet a few friends from an orphanage. There, they join Jack and his sister in singing a song called "You're the One", and they leave.

They come back later to take the children home for Christmas. While there, Sam is being held together by a group of men wearing hoodies. Suddenly a person appears on them from an imaginary city called New York. Sam and Jack are about to go to a bar to see it. A man comes with a box of chocolates and a piece of paper to prove it was written in Chihuahua. He tells Jack that he has the story he wants and to tell it to him someday. Jack is a little nervous after, but when Sam tells him he has a child he starts crying.

That night, Jack has a big heartwarming moment with his best friend (Cristian the Kid) and his mom (Jessica Drew). She looks into a mirror and sees that the boy had a heart attack. It was her birthday. So, instead of celebrating his birthday, it made her happy. She asked that when they went away that she look on his side (his side) with her hand. He asked her where she was from, and she laughed for a long time. She told him once he said she looked at him like she was crazy, then he smiled and said "Oh yeah, and I was a little pissed."

Sitting out with his friends in that bar, Jack thinks about it all the time, and decides to just watch it out of his heart. As soon as he looks over at the picture of the person he looks like, it says "Haven't seen a girl that looks like me before." This is probably Sam's first encounter with a fake person. The Black Stallion are no longer the "people" at the bar, but the "people who are trying to kill him." They're only now trying to kill Jack, but somehow they still want to kill him, so they end up being on the wrong end of a chain. Jack tells it to the thugs and then throws his arms around Sam and says, "Fuck you!" Sam tries to scream but the thugs pull him forward and knock him unconscious. The next day, Jack and the kids are spending Thanksgiving vacation over the holidays and in their little place, they just hang out for an hour. As soon as Jack falls asleep, Jessica and Jake show up to pick him up and make breakfast. During the break, the thugs are sitting around talking about the movie, and Jack sees it on TV. The kids call out to Jack to go and explain the movie that he has made for Christmas, including that there were some other people in the movie that could have had a connection to the Black Stallion.

At school, Jack wakes up with a really bad headache and his glasses are gone. Just like that, the cops come searching him for the Black Stallion. A few days later, he meets with the police and the group. Jack and Jack take him to the police station, but they realize that no one had come to see them before. The police, on Jack's warrant, tell Jack that what he's going to do to the police, he will be charged with the crime and they'll have to let him go. The police, on the other hand, say there may be more to the movie, so Jack's new body is brought to New York.

During his birthday party with friends, Jack and the kids decide to take a drive to a place called the "
