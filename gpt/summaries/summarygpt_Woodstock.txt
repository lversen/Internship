After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Woodstock Road (1972). When I received this synopsis I was looking to get my screenplay ready. After reading reviews there was lots of confusion. The author seems to be a bit lazy in his preparation.

After looking carefully at his synopsis I determined that it wasn't my first time to read the movie but first time anyone to read the synopsis. The synopsis is simple: An innocent, beautiful and loving girl who follows her father out on her adventures of the wilderness where her father's wife is dead, she ends up in the big leagues. The movie ends on an awful note when she's shot and killed in a forest and gets shot. It seems that she's gone too far off her trail and she's being pursued by bandits. I find it very difficult to get an idea of what this girl does outside of the forest. The movie ends with her out in the open and her son coming after her and she escapes out of her home. I was impressed with the character of the character. The character makes a great example of an orphan and she's a beautiful person who is also well connected to her family and who knows what kind of person her family will be. My original thought was that if the book didn't tell her father would live out his days in a house where she would be able to follow her dad without even feeling jealous. What's also interesting is that the author goes on to show that she actually lived the way her father does so she's able to see her father's character clearly in his films and how they show her his lifestyle and his work.

After some further research I was able to complete this movie as an adult. The protagonist really is a good and nice person from the beginning. He seems to see the world differently from his parents and they don't know each other as well as before. The author also gives some hints at how she may be used by her new husband by turning the other way. In particular, it seems that she may be in love with someone's son if he goes out on a date because of her boyfriend's love for the family.

What is interesting about this movie is that its author gives in to the usual pressures of being a professional and not being a nice person and also has a lot of fun showing how she seems to play with other kids and has the same way she was taught how to be a good husband. Since we are dealing with a small part of human nature and she has just graduated from middle school a major part of the story she tries to escape to hide it so that it would be more relevant for her family and her friends to understand her. So let's hope that this movie is one to watch.

So do you have any comments? I hope you liked this movie.
