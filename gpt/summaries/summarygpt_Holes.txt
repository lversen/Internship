After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Holes in Time 2, Episode 7 "Pilot":

So far we have seen several parts on "Pilot". There is an interesting one based on the movie "Pilot". In the beginning of the second half of episode 7 the pilot is shot of a group of stranded people with a little girl (the narrator's voice). The movie takes place in a futuristic world where there is no air conditioning. In the opening, a group of refugees is rescued from the debris. The episode ends with an explosion that only the survivors can see. This is the conclusion of this sequence. A lot of action. We would expect this to be a well paced and well paced series. However, once again the story is not very developed and the characters are still a mystery. The main focus is that of a group of refugees. Many moments in the movie are based on the novel by H. Schiraldi "The Book of Holes in Time: Part II" and were inspired by the TV show "Holes in Time: Part 1"

The "Mama's House" scene, the second half of the movie, was about two men in prison who try for a new life as mothers. The first part was a well paced and well paced episode as did the episode that deals with the girl and her family. I like that episode because when you have an episode like this you are setting the scene a little more interesting. The scenes are not so set up so you give the viewer more time to get to grips with what's going on. By following this simple narrative I liked the sense of the story.

The opening of "Mama's House" was in order to break the "Pilot" theme. It took place with an overcast sky and was a perfect reflection of the "Culture of the People" which is what I read.

On Sunday morning some "Mama's" who are on the way to an apartment in Paris with one of their sisters on the way are attacked by a bunch of refugees from a new city, but they fight back and end up saving the day thanks to the aid of their "Fortunes". When the refugees arrive at the station, there is a massive storm and a massive explosion makes their escape, thus opening up the first part of the episode. A more advanced action sequence was also cut. This time the refugees were still fighting one another and after a lot of tension develops. The plot doesn't really get complicated. Instead the story continues along with a few details as the refugees continue to escape.

This episode was made by Schiraldi. I wanted to make it as fun as possible for the viewers so I made the "Mama's house" (the last half of the episode) and the opening scenes (the episode where some of the refugees try to escape from the storm).
