After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Transamerica by Steve Lark

"The only thing that we can tell you that is really interesting about Transamerica is the way in which her voice fits into that of her character, and as well as the overall atmosphere. A lot of times I'm surprised that in a movie that is such a mystery you could tell only by the way she says it." – Mark Gordon

"There's probably a lot to love about Transamerica, and that does involve a certain type of storytelling that's different from much of what you see on screen… That's all well and good. But it's also the last thing you want after this movie and then you do another one." – Gary Blumenauer

As long as we're on the fence, here's what you should check out:

"Transapocalypse is a very personal movie of my life. I was actually going to release it before the film started so then I'm not sure how big of a deal it was. It wasn't that much of a box office hit, but it's not at all that surprising. It's definitely a thriller that some people may have an aversion to, but that does not mean it doesn't hold some particular importance. I think that this movie has made the gap between one who's into it and the other, because when he does come out and looks at you he'll probably think 'I haven't seen this before and this is very different to the other one,' and he'll feel the same way." – David Schwimmer

"What I love about Transapocalypse is that it takes place in a very different universe, and that shows you just how important our world is to a big swath of the human population. It's not just the most obvious example, but we're actually seeing the most complex societies that we've ever looked at, who are living together on the brink of extinction, and then I've seen that these people are dying for a reason. And it's a human thing that has to be represented in that society, but it's really not a science fiction movie. It's not real life. What happens in Transapocalypse is we show people in the world that we have nothing to do with. And in a world where people are dying for their humanity, we show the human in this world that you know, if we can save them, maybe we can save them. That's what I love." – Matthew McConaughey

"Transapocalypse is a beautifully written and deeply disturbing story. Every character and sequence in it is very moving, even those those that are simply human. Each character and sequence represents an incredible amount of information. It's an unbelievable number of things that have to be told in this time of total chaos. Not only can we only give it a chance, our world has to be changed. I do think it is an incredibly interesting movie if you understand the world as we're told it. It's a wonderful thing because it means I can show people what the world thinks about me as an individual. … That movie is such a wonderful human experience, and I believe it adds to what is so much going on in the world and how a good world can change." – Stephen King

"Transapocalypse is an incredibly moving and moving story and a very disturbing movie to say the least so that we see the end of some aspects of the world." – James Wan

"[That] scene is a very moving one and I actually love it…It's quite a fitting end to some of what we've seen before of the greats from the Marvel Cinematic Universe…I think it's very fitting to this movie now because it's one of those shows where we can see people on different pages but still see different parts of our culture and our world.

"The fact that it's a big part of that whole cinematic world is an amazing thing to watch. I am so proud of it. I haven't seen it before, so I can't really explain it." – Sean Murray

"For people who haven't seen Transapocalypse before, I truly feel like it's a dream come true and I really thank you for making us get these shows! The movies that the audience gets in the movie theatre are brilliant, and I would have loved these characters to have come from an audience that was actually very happy, and that wasn't the case with this movie. The world that this movie is about is very important, but I will say it's a joy to see them come of age and learn from their mistakes." – Mike Sussman

"I felt like a lot of the early conversations between the writers and directors that I have had going into Transapocalypse took place before I'd heard about the first movie. I was looking at people's comments about the first movie and they were saying
