After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Who Framed Roger Rabbit? The film was released as a first act, but also a sequel to the original (also starring Paul Rudd). However, this movie was considered to be much more about the lives of humans and what made them tick. In the early 20th century, some people thought that by giving humans something to do, that they would grow as people. There appeared the idea the people on Mars had been there before humans had even reached there. (I've never seen this idea even. I have never seen one where humans were not there, so it is extremely unlikely I have any clue.) Some of the more interesting examples are this image from Peter Jackson on The Hobbit where the dwarves believe humans are here before Adam and Eve. This is the same sequence as the earlier version. They just have no idea that they are here. The movie really gives you this idea that humans are also on Earth before humans have even reached there, so this is actually quite odd to many sci-fi fans. It is also rather interesting to us how the first few scenes were shot - I've said that already so that is not a bad comparison.

I believe this picture about a girl with a dream about the future is actually shot in a very simple way, but then there was an additional detail like this. It was actually one of the more interesting shots of the movie, as the world of the film was more about people than anything else, the people on their world, the people on their planet. This was very much a film about human beings, so I thought that the more interesting bits would be like this. "I know it's going to be rough out here in a lot of ways, but I think we should see some very good science fiction with a lot of different people coming to live here... we have a very complex society; we have a civilization where there is a lot of different races and religions to our people." So this one about the future is actually a very interesting look at humans and our environment and is just such a beautiful thing that I loved it. In fact I thought this picture was one of the cleverer things one could watch, as you see it was shot in a very simple way, but then things start to go downhill with humans.

So what do you think about this picture? Would you like some more of this picture about humanity as a way to meet people from other solar systems and where it is supposed to be made more accessible for others as well? And more?
