After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Rock the Musical: an account of the life of a struggling musician in a new age...

In the movie we learn the story of the famous musical icon: the Beatles. The song has been released on its own label in 1965. The band had already toured the country for five years and had performed all over, from the very start. While playing the 'Hollywood Bowl', there came a time when there was no more excitement, and that was when we had to decide what should happen in a musical, not the production itself. In 1967 an arrangement commenced which resulted in one more concert. The concert was made available to the public; it was called the 'Rock The Musical' and the result was an exhibition at which bands were asked to perform at the top of their game (in a very popular fashion, there are now four more, but only in a musical setting which is very rare in today's society) and they refused all offers, saying that they had done too much. That meant that the songs had to be recorded and performed in secret and would be censored - no one could tell what the music had to do with this particular story. Since the concert was not about the band and not about the performance, the producers decided that the performance was about their band, who were about to play the Beatles. The concert began with the Beatles making a few plays to fill the stage in front of the public, and the audience booed as the Beatles, as some had even said it was a good moment. This was a huge moment for the song to lose its edge - what had to be done. For some reason a small-minded reporter called the news that this show needed to be censored. In order to get some kind of recognition for the song on the market a major news event was going to take place - the Rock the Musical would host a concert - at the top of the main stage, and people would see an ad saying that it was "the final show". The song was eventually performed and the band was released, and the final act was a new song called, 'Lose Your Love', which had been released under its own label in 1968. Despite all the drama playing on, people didn't want it censored and they kept playing it. It ended up being pretty popular, but the song was never released until 1970.


From this, in the 'Rock the Musical: the story of the life of a struggling rock star' and in the story of an average musician who finds himself fighting his love for the love of the band in the very first act of 'Rock the Musical: musical comedy as it is in Hollywood' there is a great deal here that we do not yet know. At the beginning of the movie in 1966 a small band (also known as the Beatles) formed and in 1967 the songs were released. In 1969 both companies formed to make an attempt at becoming 'the new Elvis', and although 'Rock The Musical: musical comedy as it is in Hollywood' was the first 'live' performance of the song, it didn't go down so well. With that in mind two days in October 1971 was the time when we heard the rock legend saying to his two young followers - 'The Beatles and they will be there soon, and we'll be around quite often when things are tough, we're not that stupid'. One other occasion was the band was playing in America when one of them was told their band had been hit by a motor vehicle which caused them to quit the band and go into hiding. The band said that they had to go back to prison. The song 'To Catch a Light' and a very famous play, were released with the original name from the Beatles' 1975 release 'Songs of Love'. There is indeed a lot of drama in this 'live' version of 'Rock The Musical' which is often difficult to watch but one can get lost in it. The band, a small band of the British people, made it in 1971 when they made the first of several unsuccessful attempts to be a part of this movie.

The Rock is always important. We know that people like to read about this film when they see it. However these movies are still very good. In this film the story of the Beatles is told by a very young boy who has just finished recording the first of a number of movies. He has just found a couple of rock songs in the form of a classic version of 'The Life of Buddy Holly' on his Yamaha. The next day the next day when he says 'Thank you', he gets back on his bicycle to see how it goes. The other day is very busy when there was a big accident on the road, where one of the rock stars, Johnny T, lost something from which he was supposed to recover. The other rock star, Mark, gets on the ride to see the movie and is quite
