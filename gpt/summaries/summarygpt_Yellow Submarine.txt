10. Dark Horse (2004)

Synopsis

The director describes his vision for the movie as "a new generation has come of age, one of those who have grown up on a mission or another type of thing, and where we are now, the young man and his family, is still his father."

"The new generation is going to believe in this movie that it's so special, and because it's so exciting it's being done, we hope there's more of it, and people are going to be watching and waiting for that."

9. AMC (2009)

Synopsis

The director shares his favorite scenes from the director's 2002 masterpiece, Blue Velvet, and shares a sense of humor and insight into who he is.

"It's a movie, but no one has ever shot this movie with one person so they're looking for the right individual to use to see it."

"So, you're not just going to try and make a big big movie, you're going to open it up a little bit, and we go to the right places because we don't want to open up all the doors and feel like we can really make it really interesting. If it's a good movie you can get into any of our genres and just feel this."

"The big thing I've come to really enjoy about Blue Velvet this time, is knowing that people have been doing some serious science fiction and then coming up with new genres to explore. And we find that people actually have created interesting novels, some really interesting characters. Like, we find that even in the book, the books have a sort of weird vibe that's just kind of missing in the movie. It feels like someone's trying to figure something out but has to dig into a kind of hidden territory or a secret to find a good audience."

"It's a movie about a weird little girl that's just stuck in a dark place, and then she's going to learn about the power of being a scientist; what's in it for her? It's as close as anyone has ever come to the actual book."

"They've always had a feeling that in order for someone to get to the top at some point they need to know something. I've just learned you can never do that without making something really interesting. I love when people say it's all a trick, that you don't know the truth, and then the movie actually goes up to it and you find out."

"Everyone's like, wow, you guys seem to be so good.

"Everyone's like, you have a great idea. And that's awesome. And I think people actually have a little bit more respect for you when you're making your movies than it did when you were working with us."
