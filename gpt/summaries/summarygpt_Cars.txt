After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Cars 2 - 2 Years Before. It's a long time, and while you've been watching it for a bit, you could say I'm giving you just a short review of it. In most aspects it's quite entertaining. It really does have the vibe of a typical science fiction film, with an emphasis on high speed vehicles, lasers and robots working to survive all around each other. It is just a good thriller in its own right. What makes it so good is that it doesn't feel like it ever gets bogged down in plot and characters but rather it's an open story that takes off in the following episodes, so I have no complaints (at least, I hope not the least). It definitely feels like you have a lot more in common with the show than its predecessor, and the way that the story unfolds is well worth it. It has a strong, believable lead and some fantastic dialogue that I'm sure won't sit well with most fans of the show. It also has some interesting stories and a much more than enjoyable characterisation to it, which is nice to hear from some writers. The ending is so well written and well paced that I believe many readers will consider it a good read, especially given the first season finale that began it. In summary: I would rate this as 1 star out of 2 if you had a serious interest and don't mind skipping ahead. I really, really loved it, I really enjoyed it...but will it change anything?
