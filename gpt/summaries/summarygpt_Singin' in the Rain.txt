After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Singin' in the Rain is the last story set in the U.S. I feel the movie should be adapted by the U.K. It was the last one that was broadcast.


"I know it makes these things sound like two separate movies"

"I know that. It's just part of what sets it apart from other dramas. It's a good comedy." -Ewan McGregor


"Singin' in the Rain" has already been in theaters for quite some time due to other great films by Wong Kar-wai, but I decided to watch this movie first, because this film is the best and best original drama I can think of. It's a funny but honest movie about the lives and struggles of ordinary people who end up on the road together. This screenplay is also a good script for a children's film.
