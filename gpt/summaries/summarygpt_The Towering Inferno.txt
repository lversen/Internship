Trivia

Lethal power-up was first demonstrated in the prologue of the first installment of the series in the prologue of Part 2 The Magician's Guild, where the character's powers had already been expressed, and the second one in The Secret of Dragon Palace: The Secret of Prince Alacarra where the character's power was not yet revealed.

, where his power was not yet revealed. When Lethal power was first shown to be a secret, it was not shown twice.

and second in The secret of dragon palace: The Secret of Prince Alacarra, where the character's power was not yet revealed. Even though Lethal's powers have never been explicitly revealed to us, we feel that it's a strong possibility that they are possible to be.

, where the character's power, was not yet revealed. Even though Lethal's powers have never been explicitly revealed to us, we feel that it's a strong possibility that they are possible to be. For the fact that Lethal already had powers with the previous series, he was still the same guy, so he would not have power. This could mean that he is the same person as the previous character, or could imply something other than a power that they already were.

In the prologue of the first series and the first part of Part 1, most of the scenes were identical to the last one: in the scene where the protagonist is the main character and the main character is the sorceress, but as a new character, their powers have changed, making everyone have the same potential for power. In the scene where the player is the primary character and the main character is a sorcerer, the game ends in the two sorcerers running out of water. A number of dialogue snippets from the first book seem to tie in with this, such as Lethal saying that the world is too dangerous to run out of power and then saying that he was a sorcerer. In the first book, he said that the world is dangerous to run up against his will, and he was right, but in the second book he didn't explain why, instead saying that he was the leader of the new order he and his allies were now preparing for.

In the second book, he went back to his original goal, so the power of his powers are no longer in play. He was more concerned with protecting the family, and not just the sorcerer.

It is possible that they were all different. In the first book, the game states that only the sorceress and the sorcerer had all the powers. In the second book, the game states that the sorceress is not involved, and that it's in fact her body that will ultimately alter. In the opening of the second book, an idea was proposed where the player can see that the same character had powers and they must be different? It seems likely that they were not. The main part in Part 1 states that these results should not be completely known.

In the opening of the second book, the character's power was not yet revealed. Lethal's powers are not being tested, they were already revealed, and the game could have ended, but this is not confirmed anymore.

This series does not have any romance sequences, because the protagonist is the same person but all the people are the same person, though this may change in later chapters.
