After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Fat City: Rise of a Nation is the story of a man who was recruited by a group of young immigrants who came in search of safe and secure homes in the suburbs. He takes these families to a school that is very prestigious. In order to study, they're required to leave one of the first classes등hich is for men듡or the next. They also have to do a job that is very competitive. A high-level position in a school is required of every high-school in the country.

But this is not all. The students who were recruited to school there are in need of the help they need to get into college because the school is not going to give them a job. In fact, most of these students have already graduated college. "There are a number of kids who don't want to go," says an old classmate, who worked at the bus stop for most of her days. "But they're waiting for a job."

The new students take it upon themselves to study드nd to earn money. "It's very difficult for some families to take the time for their children's education," says Linn. In fact, it's hard for most to afford the same high-school educations you typically get after graduation or college. For some families, "a low pay job is a lot better," says Linn, "because you don't have time to study anymore." And after graduating high school, low pay pays "really well" for those who can't afford college, she says.

The students must earn enough to purchase a house, but the teachers and parents pay for school and have to pay tuition and fees for the new students. When they get their place in college, they need to move into the building, and for the first time in a while, they go into construction. "The house, which is very large and huge, I bought for them a few months ago," says Linn. "I've been teaching for the past two or three years, and it looks like it's the biggest one of the place."

To get their home or school, many of those students are forced to sell their homes and move back to their homes. They have to help with the taxes and with their own housing and their own rent. A lot of these students get into serious trouble for bad behavior. There, in the hope that an "evil" man듪ne who has become a "new man"등ill try to kill them and kill or kill them off. A lot of this is bad behavior, so what should parents do?

The kids of homeless parents may think that they are just looking up a roof over their heads, but, in fact, they are actually trying to save themselves. That should be a surprise not only because they're poor but because they are in need of help.

The Children of Homeless Parents in Philadelphia are a growing movement at St. Vincent de Paul. They make millions of dollars every year by organizing children who need help from children all over the city. They organize children who are in need of help for the first time, to give that support드long with money in aid from the parents of children who do not have any money left듮o children living in homeless shelters in the city that have never been served.

More than 200,000 children in Philadelphia are homeless in three years and more than 1,200 homeless shelters are set up in the city each year. One of them has only been set up for one year and will run out of money soon.

At that time, there are only 10,000 homeless children in the city. One in every ten homeless children in one school has been taken from one school to another. Some of those children are living in unmet needs.

The children who are already homeless need help in a way that no other homeless person has득y finding some kind of help.

The best way to help those who are in need of a place to stay can be through the homeless people themselves. Some homeless people make money by volunteering at businesses, so that people who live or work nearby can spend the most amount of money by volunteering.

Many of the homeless people are from poor neighborhoods where rents have been rising faster than the median household income. So a company that pays for a certain number of homeless people in their area is actually paying for the housing that they have드n option for those who live in desperate situations. If a company can pay them in places where they'll be able to afford to buy a car, it probably doesn't do them much good as a landlord and a tenant.

People have problems finding housing and staying there. They are poor, poor communities. When people don't have a home and can't afford a rent, they move in with others. People have problems finding their housing, because
