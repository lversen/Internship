After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Orlando: The Story of Oscar Pistorius, by James Franco

(You might wonder why the movie isn't being used in any mainstream production, I'll prove it by playing this game here - and you can hear me say that for the rest of the movie - I hope I didn't have to explain the story as it doesn't matter).

The problem is, when I say, not only is this an amazing movie that has everything you want for an adult movie, but it also has all of this. There's not just one movie, at this point. We're not even allowed in the back. In fact, there's only ONE movie on the DVD which isn't even for adult audiences but does do something that makes me cringe.

In the end, as with the others, I came up with this, and it's fantastic. You'll want to see it for yourself.

This is definitely the last thing I wanna say to this man, I'm so sad when I find people who won't stand up and call for such a great movie. Especially if it was made by someone who would be my brother.

Also, here's what I said about the ending:

The final words:

After watching this movie a number of times, I'm still waiting for the end of my love affair I've been having with this movie.

I didn't think they'd get to actually kill Anthony so there's no way he should die anyway when he gets back.

It's great to see they just don't give a shit about me. They don't care about this little one...

(We're doing it again...just for your information, sorry, I'm having fun now and this is just going to make me feel really terrible for a minute...)

I'm almost done looking again at this movie. The things that I love about this film, I believe they love. I love that they made a movie about an adult kid, a child who's just being bullied about the things that he's told.

I hate that this movie was made for a child.

I hate this movie, and I didn't even realize that a 10 year old could take such a horrible movie to a whole new level.

You can find more about Anthony and the other adults that were on this list at this link.

Thank you for reading, you really gave me the best time I've had. Let me know your thoughts on the subject, have fun with your thoughts, and make sure your friends know what you're thinking about.

I think you all will like Anthony, if you've got any of your doubts.

Also, you can't come up with the right line "Why wouldn't it just be about you?"

And yes, I know what to say. You'll want me to say it so that that we all know what a lot of us can't have in common.

Thank you.

My very last review review was for This Is How We Do Movies about a young adult man. He got killed, and I wrote a review and it was a masterpiece of hard comedy. He was too old for the role that he deserved when most other adult movies are made of kids. He did a lot of bad comedy, so much that the idea of having him die in one of these really bad movie was just...I was just really depressed about him too much to do that. There are so many reasons to choose the movie, some that would appeal to a much younger audience, others would appeal to younger audiences because of their age, even if they do end up liking it. And because that's what I wanted to do, I did it. Not because I wanted to be the son of the wealthy child I grew up with, but because, on my part, I wanted to do my best to live through another day. Not because I wanted to live on a ranch with my family while living in an abandoned house, or that I really needed a lot of food for the next two months, or that I wanted to go swimming, but because I wanted to be like a normal kid who wanted to do his best to get where he wants to in life. I loved the fact that my sister wanted me to do what I do best. Not because I'm an easygoing person, or even because she likes being in my shoes, but because I know my time at home is coming to an end because I want to have the most fun I can. It was just all of that for me. I was at my best when I was young, I couldn't be at my best when I was young.
