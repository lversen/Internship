After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Man of Steel (2003). When the director takes over the story, he creates a new book about Superman, an ensemble story with all the different character arcs that Superman had, as well as the various intergalactic heroes. He also sets it upon the character of Superman himself. He starts out telling a story that is much more interesting than any given film that has ever been attempted before. And that is, a very, very, very nice movie. It is certainly one of the best stories of the 20th century.
