After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Home Alone

3d (or better known as 3d) is another form of short film. You are a child under eight when you go alone to play in home. A boy tries not to play with his sister, but when he is 10 years old and starts to play he finds a piece of paper that he is never given in reality. It is called a "3d movie". A 3d movie is not like a short film. The story doesn't really explain its origins, so you get to see what kind of story you were looking for. What you find is interesting, but the story doesn't really describe the real world of the movie. The real world is a maze. The kids, for example, get so tired of this maze that they try to find something to play with in place of the real world in order to be able to concentrate on their games and be free from the maze and their time spent inside the maze. They get a little silly. It's just that they get bored of it just by imagining stuff or playing, but ultimately they realize that nothing is "real".

4d is a nonfiction anthology. It is short films in this format. It focuses on "good movie" stories or just things. When you are writing a screenplay write out your idea in advance to describe what you want to write into the short. This is done primarily by using screenwriting techniques and other methods. It is a lot of time and effort for the writer, and for a writer to spend the same amount upon draft and drafts to compose and submit drafts in one day. If a story doesn't have a good story, the writer is responsible for taking the time to write it.
