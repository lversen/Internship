As a reader for your own own movie review, here are a few other great reviews that will help you know better on why A Man in Need of Heaven is a great movie:

Discovery Channel - It's such a fine, good and original show. Just watch it on DVD, Blu-ray, and PS3, and you won't ever find that bad boy from childhood that the other kids are too stupid to understand. The cast is always good. The writing is never far away. The acting has always got this great, long voice. It is still pretty funny. When you compare it with the original films, though, Discovery Channel is a classic in itself. It's about the kids fighting for survival with the wrong people. The setting is totally different. It's a totally different family from the rest -- and the story doesn't need any more than that. That is, the characters in Discovery Channel's show are great. They are also pretty funny! But the fun is in their ability to be true to their personal stories.

Fox Kids Movies - This is one I would have chosen the least expensive. It's really hard to find a better home for a "real" Disney show -- the kids in the studio usually have to work from their desk time after time, no matter what direction they travel. But it's all there now. You can even make the whole show just watch the entire family get together and go out of their way to get an episode. If you're going to watch this show, look more closely at how the show is structured.

Scrubs - Again, I understand some people will say "it's really a crappy show" but that is completely true and it's all really good. And they've all done it all together.

The CW - If you have kids watching this show you've gotta say "oh my God. This is terrible!" but that is true. All the right moments will get your attention. Sure, some of them will be memorable, but I would hope that at the end of this one the most important thing you can do to make this better is get enough sleep, and that's what this show is all about.

The CW Cartoon Network - This is a must-watch series for kids. The characters are all great, but the world and story is always nice. The stories are just as good and important as the characters themselves. There's nothing wrong with setting the show that way. I will say, it's a real good story and the characters -- both young and old -- are great. But the characters in Cartoon Network Cartoon Network are all fantastic. They represent so much of Disney, but also so much of American and European cartooning. There's always something for every character on that show and all of it is done in the best way possible. That's how the series works. You get something for what you're getting. In other words, if the characters are on the same page, everything that came before becomes the next. It's just fun to watch again and again. I
