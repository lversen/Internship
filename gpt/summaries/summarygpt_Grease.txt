After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Grease is a series of flashbacks from The Purge, In Flames, Into the Deep, and some of the previous short films. The film begins with a flashback to the end of the last film Grease. The film ends with an appearance in episode four which features James Franco as James Joyce. Then the film opens with James Franco playing John Doe. In all episodes, a flashback unfolds which is of a young boy at a bar in St. Francis. James is shown to be in a bar with others drinking and when a bar worker asks about James's situation, James tells the bartender a "you don't think I'm the best bar worker". The bartender proceeds to ask James if he's got any friends. James informs the bartender that James doesn't know anyone, but immediately goes into a car and drive away. The car gets stopped at a red light. The bar worker then drives him into the white car and drives away with James in the car. James goes to the car and drives into an overturned car and the car goes off the road. The driver of the lost vehicle then pulls up next to the wrecked car and says "what's your name", where James was said to be the man mentioned to be driving the car. The car crashes down the road and in a way, is a parody of the accident scene of The Purge where James and the other people in the car are transported out of the accident scene of The Purge and to the hotel room. The same scene happens two scenes later in which a girl who was drunk in his car is saved by his older sibling, but James (the younger brother) becomes obsessed with revenge for the accident (which he later takes as revenge for being cut from the book he was reading). He wants revenge. James is given a phonebook filled with various personal information and a picture of a picture of the man he was in the car with. He doesn't give it to The Purge. James convinces James not to give it. James gets over this and says he will do it. In the end, when they leave to go get some pizza James asks The Purge to get one as they are getting ready for the party and James then gives the pie to James and everyone starts talking and he asks his mom about James Joyce, he then goes get it. John Doe enters the movie making the scene but there appears to be a pause in the middle of the movie. John Doe is shown at an ATM on Friday. James tells James Joyce that he was in a bad relationship and he got so mad and did whatever he could to get that relationship back. John Doe told James after it's over that he is going to jail

Film

This is a brief mention of the scene in which James (the older brother) and the woman he was to get his pizza has a sexual encounter. At that time, James (the older brother)'s friend, who was drunk on a cold drink, (who was also drunk in the past on drugs) is seen grabbing James (this is his first encounter with James Joyce) by the chin and pushing him to the ground. James then has his hand over James' shoulder for a while before finally kissing him.

After that scene is over, James goes back to that restaurant. James is not allowed at that restaurant, while he was with his mom. When the two meet in an attempt to find a safe place to stop his relationship he tells his mom that he's going to a motel for the next couple of months. James, of course, doesn't want to return to those two since they would have done what they had to do to get into a safe place.

When James and he and his sister go out to get some pizza they are not allowed near the area from a parking lot because James told John Doe not to get into any sort of altercation when he first saw them there. Later he and his sister get to the hotel. It is revealed that on Friday night James (the younger brother) was there when two of his friends, a young woman and her best friend were having a threesome with another gay man. As they watched, James and John Doe ran back inside the room to see John Doe. James went to the police to talk to her and she gave him a police letter stating she had a boyfriend. The letter was said to be written by James' old girlfriend. However, on the first day of the shooting, when James got the letter, John Doe was present in the hotel room to help get the situation under control. The story goes that some time after John Doe gets the letter, he was in the lobby of a store and he notices a gun inside, but his uncle later found it while he was looking for James. It's been suggested that if he has a gun, he might have been able to shoot the man at the store.
