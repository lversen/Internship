After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Piccadilly Circus by Paul Simon

Rating: Unrated

Summary The final two episodes of this film show how we can make our audience enjoy this masterpiece of an original story by Paul Simon. This is their favourite and most poignant film, especially after it is the centre of new horizons for British cinema.

A man who is a genius in his own right (Pablo Picasso) travels off of a horse as well as he finds his dream of making his own films (he does this by producing three films that are well worth watching together) whilst also striving to create a better way out, albeit with the help of a large number of his admirers.

At a loss, he is left to wonder why a very young young man from a family of horses had chosen to make his own films and instead decided he would do the same, which then turns out to be an incredible achievement, for one simple reason, if one can see the potential of a great filmmaker to make his own films and still be able to make an impact - as soon as he has taken up the dream and taken it seriously, he is not alone (Bilal Yousafzai, for example, will also play a key role in this movie).

The journey is not merely a process of discovery or trial and error. The filmmakers have been playing with different perspectives for years - as far back as 1987, when Richard Wagner and David Foster Wallace and, most importantly, John Ford (also playing William Shatner) came up with their own style of thinking, starting with 'A Clockwork Orange' - and it is by working with different types of directors from all over the world and having it be a truly unique piece, it's possible to do this. So far, the concept for this film has been that the heroines of their world have to make their own films. So, as such, there must be a certain level of freedom, of choice and choice to take to achieve their aims, while other characters must fight against the forces of the universe. But, as we already show, it is at this stage that an individual can come up with an idea of what he wants to do, for his 'dream' is already being explored.

And the idea that this will be more of a 'new thing' for the audience than an old one is certainly a great one.

A great filmmaker has chosen to make his own films (and do so with great enthusiasm so that they may appeal to a wider audience), but here at the risk of sounding too harsh, his process of making the film was not unique to his own experience. The first thing I would like to see more of in this movie is the possibility that another person's vision might be of greater interest to him - this is not to say we can give you more of this film when we're done, but please, there are so many more films out there already.

One of the things that I would like to see more of this film is having this discussion of the role of the protagonists and the role of the character in the film. The story of the novel and the story of the book (or just about anything about cinema), in this case, were very different to the ones we had before. Perhaps, then, we can give a general interpretation of this.
