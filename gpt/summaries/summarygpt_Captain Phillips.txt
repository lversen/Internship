After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Captain Phillips

My first draft of the screenplay took place before the Captain Phillips novelization of the Captain Phillips/Crazy Ex-Girlfriend movie, in which Kevin Costner's character was kidnapped by the villainous Jack, Jack's last son. With the exception of a few sequences, it's clear that the villain worked with Jack's wife, Marlene, because they've no real relationship to begin with.

There were only thirteen scenes of the movie which actually got my attention. On four page synopsis notes it mentions a group of men led by Captain Phillips having sex without even the presence of a female character on screen. That's it! Jack is going to kill all of these men, which it doesn't tell you. It also mentions a few specific things that Jack must do to get to Jack. However, I think "Captain Phillips" still has that very important thing going for him – he needs to figure out what Jack wants and how he wants to play out the situation and his life with all these different people in his life has changed (mostly that of his wives).

Finally, the synopsis notes for the movie have the following paragraph that lists all of what's available:

Jack's actions bring about his redemption and his eventual transformation into a man who is in a state of being controlled by another man. In his mind Jack has become nothing more than a man who is controlled by another man. The only man that holds Jack accountable for his actions is himself…Jack is a man who wants nothing more than to kill the man who is the only one he should be trying to protect.

He was the first to write this review and he will be the first to thank me for giving him credit for his time. I can understand the sentiment, and it's why I didn't read it in the previous year. But that also isn't the end of "Captain Phillips" – it's just the beginning. It all comes together in a new film, and it's in the form of the story.
