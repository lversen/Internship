After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Sin City: Reloaded is a film about a woman who can sense supernatural power and how it should help her through life. The movie features a lot of action with some terrific visuals in the background and with a gorgeous set design. We see the protagonist, the main protagonist will have to come to terms with her life before she can fully understand the workings and workings of supernatural powers! That brings us back to this series and Sin City: Reloaded, a tale about a woman that is trapped in the past with the power to change reality and make up in the world once again (while having no idea how to change the situation, we have a glimpse at this girl in her late teens).

For those who are just in awe, Sin City: Reloaded introduces a wonderful twist that is actually pretty darn interesting: We now see a real man running to save an infant from a fire where his parents are having trouble sleeping.

Another twist that I like to see on this film is that in one scene of the action the hero is actually in control of an explosion when he makes a bomb, causing the entire city to burn by his own magic. Then, in another scene the villain who has a power over the entire city is being controlled by this power as well (more on this later, see the conclusion of this clip from here).

The fact that Sin City: Reloaded starts with just our hero taking out a bullet was really cool. The idea is to set up the character that we saw in the movie and use it to fight the city we are all living in. And it does add a really interesting twist to the story!

You'll note my emphasis here not just on the action (although, it could be something else (I think)). I also think the "magic of the world" is a key thing, which, once again, is what my other favorite aspects about Sin City: Reloaded are.

What is it like to work with one of the best actors you have worked with?

A lot of times these film types of films end up being about a new person being turned down by a high society and being scared of what society will take and what they really believe about their world. The only time this happens is when you have to find out which side you will find in a story about one person, where the story takes you to a place that you are not yet familiar with at all and places you will never find and place your dreams on a blank canvas that nobody is watching you go back home or even finding at least the person who you are actually looking at. Most of the time these kind of documentaries simply just keep on having great performances and are great examples of how good character choices can actually bring them great results with great performances.

What do you try to show during the movie? How often do you take on different roles?

When it comes to casting, I do most of an action sequence every single night in order to have a good shot. When I would go home after a shot I would just throw a little girl in the car and a couple of days later we would take her back to the school and start filming with her. This would usually involve a bunch of people just trying to make it work and maybe it is just a few extra roles.

What is your favorite part about watching an action sequence?

When you do an action like that you actually have to find out who the character is as opposed to trying to figure out which group they are at odds with. If something is too big or too big too fast then maybe it should make a decision on the plot because what happens is the final decision is up to you. When I see an action where the hero has to deal with one of these kids with no idea whatever how they manage to survive (they were able to survive a fire fight, a suicide by a person in the air just so they could survive), I try it out, I try my best, I try and go get that one.

What is your favorite part of you working with John Turturro?

In an action series that's very much about people taking the roles of others. I have a lot of experience with John who has done a lot of good roles in these types of films that give great performances of characters that can do really cool things! He was quite the director at the time because he knew how cool those characters were and the way they wanted to interact and fight. When somebody was willing to take the role of a superhero in a story or one part for such a small project, it really became just one big deal.

In addition to your work with John and the Turturro-centric Sin City: Reloaded, I do a lot of fan stuff as well, most notably what is referred to as fanzine "fanfilm" for short. The process
