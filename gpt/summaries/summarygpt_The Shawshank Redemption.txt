After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Shawshank Redemption.

Cindy (Michelle Williams) takes a trip to the Caribbean to talk to a woman who is missing two children. To make sure her children's lives are safe she meets a couple in his hometown of Houston. As he leaves for the holiday, his wife gets an important request from an elderly man. An old man who has been drinking with his daughter and her mother finds out that they have an affair. Meanwhile, Hank finds out that he is a thief who has stolen some of his money for his own personal protection when he is kidnapped. In the meantime, the two of them must track the thief down (though the thief has to pay the ransom.)

A year later, Hank gets the phone call that makes his world a better place due to the kidnapping and he has to decide how much to trust that man. Though this part starts off nicely with Hank telling the young woman to meet the man, the moment turns extremely sinister as he becomes the one to save the life of his daughter. This becomes something of a recurring theme, one in which Hank and his character have a very different relationship. Both are victims of a brutal crime and at the risk of turning their lives upside down when they are betrayed to the poor man, they will have no choice but to keep on going after the money the man stole that the woman had helped them for.

There is some tension, particularly in the first few scenes, but if they were a movie, I'd go with A Star With Stars, because it is a very different movie that has some great characters, and more than enough people going with these characters that we can see that this is not a typical bad movie for someone trying to do a good job. You know, just trying to follow people around without getting lost in the middle of some weird business area. When people make it through the main story we are all trying to look at the most interesting people in a darkly funny way. The fact that this show wants to show you that you aren't just going to get into certain places but that your main character lives in certain places and if you're a rich kid you'll be spending less time in those places.

It also makes more sense if you watch this show that Hank has a relationship with the woman who is missing. That is, if you believe that Hank is the only one who's around because he was the only one to take the opportunity that came with being on the mission. He goes to the very end of his mission to rescue her but you would never believe that the woman in this entire show knew his identity and that the two of them were engaged. The movie does this really well, but it also starts to turn very dark and depressing when the man who was kidnapped dies in the car. The whole series ends with Hank trying to help the child who is missing, which is basically the ending of his story. There is no way for Hank to keep taking his job, he dies in a mysterious car crash and the other person is now gone from the show. That's a kind of tragedy.

But the movie ends with Hank thinking that the woman who was missing is his wife and they are going to marry. Yes, he's going to have a relationship with her, and some of it's going to involve his children, but it's definitely not like all of it will be a part of the story.

The entire show moves from one scene to another with a wonderful, well-designed ending. There are some moments that might be lost or that could be taken off-screen, but they all remain well and truly there. In fact, there are some of them, especially in the final scenes, that I still would've liked to see go with the ending.

But given the circumstances, let me explain the ending to you. In one scene, Hank's wife is visiting her boyfriend and trying to get to her own house when the couple are driving. Once she leaves she doesn't return home, leaving him to deal with his daughter, as she says he "always has to die for her." Meanwhile she finds out that she is really gone from his job, and the movie starts to end in an incredibly disturbing way as he loses his wife. And he also loses his wife who was just so nice as Hank's wife in the end. So you end up with a bad, tragic ending for a movie that uses a combination of these characters with varying personalities to create such a terrifying ending that you wouldn't want to see in today's movie medium. But I do think that the movie is very good over and over again and even if it wasn't it's still one of the best movies I've seen and still a great movie.

You can watch all seven episodes of Hank's show "A Star With Stars."
