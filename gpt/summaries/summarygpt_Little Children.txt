After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Little Children of the Damned 2 (1999)

Little Children of the Damned 2 opens in a trailer, with the movie playing out in a trailer. For a while we never knew what would happen next before we saw it, like when a kid was crying "I love you" at the movie's end. But we still love this kid, but it was a little while before we recognized him and started talking. Not only is he a little bit funny with the characters and their actions, but he's also a bit of a sweet, funny, nice-hearted guy just sitting out in the trailer feeling like he just got this good. Little Children of the Damned is a really great movie but it's also a movie about not only a good time but also a really sweet time. It's a good movie. I loved that scene with the boy named Piggot. Little Children of the Damned is a really good movie, but it really did not stand up to what was presented in its movie (though I know most people are not like that). It's a good movie and it's something we should watch more. I thought "I just want [the opening scene] to have a strong ending!" Now that is a lot to see if anybody can put together on that line.
