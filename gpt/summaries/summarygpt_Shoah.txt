After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Shoah, The Wrath of God and The Fall of the Republic #1. This post is not in any sense about "how a movie ends." It is about "why a movie is good or bad and how to do it, in other words, how to play with the things that make it fun." I will say one of the reasons why I made this film was to play with things that make movies fun. I've become more interested in playing with time-travel when I'm writing and when I don't have a job and can't get through a movie. I'm getting a little more comfortable playing with time traveling in movie scenes. Not just by playing them, but trying to remember them. I've started to see The Wrath of God as an experience movie. It gives us the impression of being transported with an old book. I've often imagined taking that time to actually explore a place while I sit on a bench, playing with objects and looking over the top. The whole idea of time travel has made me want to play a little bit more. And I'm still not sure why.


But the reason I wanted to do The Wrath of God is because it is the reason that I started going in that direction in my life. I'm not about to change anything about my life. Not to say it's the beginning of what I want, I just want to be able to play with something interesting or I couldn't do it. Because it's a different experience, and that's a huge experience, and I love playing with things. So I wanted to do this to be a fun one and a great one. It is, by the way, just a part of my life and that's why I decided to make it. It's an experience, I guess, that I need to experience.


The thing with this concept of time travel is that it's the movie that brings people in to explore space for the first time. In a sense it is the beginning of what I want movies to be, a kind of journey towards that. There are things that really need to come to a close for this movie, but they require us to do things that make it fun and entertaining. It's time.
