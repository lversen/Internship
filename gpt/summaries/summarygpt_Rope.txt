After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Rope: The Life and Deaths of the Coven

1/26/15 The Film Set a different timeline for the future, and I wanted to explore that. (In "Plan 9: The Time Travelers" by Eric Gagneck, this synopsis of the universe we've come to know as the Ropes is from the Book of Job.)

The film is set on the events of this movie, which took place before the story was released. As a timeline we can now understand how the events of this movie relate to any part of the film timeline but not the prequel timeline, though it makes sense to re-live these events in order to see how things turn out next time around. This was a difficult concept to develop, and ultimately the prequel timeline had to break the cycle of the prequel timeline. I think these days in the Ropes universe we'd need to change the timeline with the movie, but that doesn't feel like it would happen for the films.

In part two of the movie we'll return to the first two Ropes movies we've seen, both in 3D, when in 2D it's a film with a 3D environment. I felt the movie was best served with an alternate timeline, as you'd expect from Gagneck's description, but if you've never seen the prequel movies it sounds odd that we didn't ask about these two. I'm not too sure if you've seen the 2D movies or the HD movies, but if you look closely at the 3D one I think it's pretty clear how it looks: the 3D of the movie looks something like this (as before we're looking at the POV):

This is a pretty good representation of the timeline. It's pretty clearly how it was built, though. This is not the very first or second Ropes movie we've heard of so far.

It's pretty well-timed when it comes to what happens next. We've already seen the Ropes movie, but it's only in the first issue (and that's just a few of the pages). There are several new Rope characters in this issue who we could introduce (not mentioned) as part of the story (like Mike the Owl who's played by Peter Jackson, he's also played by Dave Bautista). The Ropes can be taken to different timelines, we can assume, but I want to focus on the new Ropes Rope

A more familiar character called James is currently reprising his role as the Rope, not a full role. He's currently in the first issue and can possibly be put in a slightly more prominent role by the next movie. Of course, I can't see James being in the role of Rope, and I doubt he'd be a part (he's in New York). Mike is very much a part of the Ropes to a certain degree, though I see that Michael is a very different character, or at least in some ways he'd be in the role of Rope in the Ropes

That's the most important part of this movie: setting a new timeline for the movie and the prelude timeline for the movie's narrative. Even if the movie doesn't set a timeline but it's also very easily understood that both timelines are connected – they are that and it's why they exist.

The Ropes trilogy was really all about making a movie about those three, when they could not have seen each other in a more interesting light because of their own connection. The timeline we see now (at least in the early episodes) was designed to keep things interesting; it's about all of those two interconnected. The prequel timeline, after all, gave us so many more interesting, time-bending and personal story developments, which was a great part of our goal to present to the future, and for the future of this generation of audiences seeing the film through its very beginnings.

There is something new that I think will be interesting to note with the story, and it's the first one after the Ropes series, as we've seen the story in this movie.

A new dimension, one that is still unknown to most of the audiences, and the first time we see a Rope: The Life and Deaths of the Coven series, will take place in the mid-to-late season. In this case it's on screen.

This is interesting, and hopefully will become clearer as we get closer to the premiere. I love the fact that this movie opens with a very long preview of one of the main plotlines that have nothing to do with the story and everything to do with character development:

We're finally now looking at the beginning of a brand new Rope: The Life and Deaths of the Coven, and the first part
