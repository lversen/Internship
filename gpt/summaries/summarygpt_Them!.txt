After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Them! The Return of King Kong!

The movie began at the 4:09 mark of its production. The movie featured three actors from the original version starring in the same movie, each as slightly different characters.

I'm fairly new to the new TV series, particularly by a good reason. I first noticed an oddness about this film in the film teaser, that was in part due to the fact that the cast of Kong has been added before the first one.

Here they are: [In the pre-production stage] "Kong" has been introduced, but not the last. He and his father are not the main characters in the movie; they are some of the film's more interesting characters. I see the movie in its original form as one of the "lost," and perhaps the lost will be a part again when The Avengers 2 comes out. Although I have never heard of a Lost movie like that, I expect this one might be very popular with fans of the films. The movie did not start out like most of the original Kong movies, so I can only bet that it was a bit of anticipation that the movie's release and distribution was very large.

A few days later I got a message from T.J. Lee (his ex-wife, on whom in the movie we've been to work on the project of directing the sequel) and told him that it was about to happen. (The story is set in the 1990s, which is about a time during which Kong was still an orphan that, after an accident, he and his family ended up in New York City.) He knew that for the sake of time the films would only be released at the Academy Awards.

"If I am correct," Lee told Lee, "would you consider him an "agent" for T.J. and his other actors to direct the film? Wouldn't you consider him one of his friends?"

I don't know. Lee said as much. (Yes, a lot of directors are known to like taut and unpredictable projects.) I thought Lee had a pretty good feeling. I asked his agent what Lee thought of T.J. and his new friends before any of this. He asked the same thing, which was pretty strange. But then he replied, to Lee's surprise, because he's not so nice. He was impressed that he was on board, and that he was able to come up with some of the movie's most complex character and idea.

And before I could conclude whatever this would mean, Lee came out of the movie very excited, saying that this was "a little bit closer to the original."

Here's how it went:

The first movie is about an orphan named Kong. There's an idea to bring new people into the world of Kong and make them feel at home. The kid's name is "Kunwen" and will be named after the "Kong Song." A friend or sibling of the orphan is "K-En." It's a small town for two boys and a girl called Kang. Two characters are being introduced. There's a story about which I was somewhat surprised. It seemed that the kids that were originally introduced have had an easy time in their careers. But "Kunwen" and "Kang" are supposed to be friends. When this is added to the story, they get special powers of sight.

Kung's father is on the phone and says to Kong that he isn't a star, since his parents passed away. When Kong hears this, he realizes that there was a lot going on. He's still looking for friends and he's wondering what Kong does with his life. When he gets an idea that Kong will be coming back, she runs off to call the police. When she gets back, Kong gets a call from her mother. She tells her dad that Kang has decided that he likes her, so that he can find a new friend. When Kang hears the news, she tells the cops that Kong's father didn't approve of him, so he thinks it's a matter of time until Kong becomes a star. So he works with a very famous actor in his family to get the girl back and decides to do something with that child. And it's all totally cool. Now if I didn't write this, it wouldn't have gone over well.

After that first movie, Kong's mom is gone. An old friend of Kong's who now lives nearby, Jaws takes up the part of his dad. When the two get engaged, Kong becomes a master swordsman. When Kong realizes what his new friends are going to do for him, he starts putting him through the motions, learning all sorts of new techniques. (He's also working with Jaws who is on a training program for professional wrestlers
