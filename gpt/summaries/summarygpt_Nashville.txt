After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Nashville, USA. First the title of the movie. Then the description and location of an encounter which leads up to a meeting of the audience and a question of what the film will be about.

The first time I actually saw this movie, I was curious to learn more about this story and I have been enjoying it well. On my last trip to Los Angeles I did a quick look up about Nashville and thought of this movie as a series of episodes. After that I also had quite a lot of fun with the movie which is what started me to feel that I was ready for a new film. While there were some interesting concepts that popped up in the synopsis the opening scenes didn't really break with where the story takes place in some places. So I thought I would give another look at Nashville.

A lot of this movie took place after one of VFX's, Matt Rennie, left his mark and was hired. He was a guy who is still very well known and his work has been pretty well documented and was a really fun experience reading these pictures over and over. I was even able to talk to some of these people about their experiences from reading this movie and after reading the stories I had some idea how these are actually going to take place.

Now I'm excited for the second half of the show, especially because I thought I might have some ideas for it I was able to do the first half in three days. Although I have to admit it doesn't look like that at all I am a pretty excited person. It is a little bit more of a surprise to me as I've only done a little research of this movies when not so great, but I would like to think a lot.

The second half, you get a little more into the background than at the beginning where you learn about this one character with the help of characters with the same name, including a pretty cool old man and his new love interest.

Well this will only get more interesting, right? But that's the real story of this movie and I'm sure it will inspire someone who doesn't like to watch, right? In this way, the film doesn't quite feel like it has the audience, but it does add to the world, especially as I'm trying to keep my imagination open a little as I read the stories and not just give them a little extra space I have an idea.

In the first half I read more about Rennie working with and watching this film and really wanted to know who this guy truly is. I was intrigued by the world he was living in and how his character is all connected to each other so I was eager to dig deeper and get an idea about Rennie doing more with each of them. Here is the synopsis for the second half, here is the description of the first and last half of the movie

In the midst of his adventures, a family tragedy comes to a head in Nashville. Matt Rennie and his girlfriend, Tiana M. are stuck in a haunted house after being robbed, their car stolen by criminals and Matt must work for the Sheriff's department even after all these years of hard work.

Rennie has a dream, but the other half of the family decides to take action and become the Sheriff's Detective. The next day Matt dreams about a meeting between Tiana M and someone from a long tradition in the movie that will make it clear if they ever become sheriff. The sheriff's department is not the only place they look for a sheriff's department but when one of their deputies returns to make a mistake with a key he calls upon Tiana M to use that as the catalyst to get them out of their car.

Tiana M is a well known detective in the movies and also for real this story is set in Nashville where it is stated they will be traveling with a "ghost" for the night with Matt and Tiana M. With Matt's help and the help of friends such as Bob Marley and his wife, Maitland and his wife and co he sets out to find a place where the residents of Nashville will take refuge and help them get out of this place.

When Matt is stopped by his friends Tiana M and the Sheriff's Department gets a call. Matt answers it as the two of them are headed there to find some help and their situation is starting to get out. Once they arrive the two are greeted by Rob, who takes them to a car parked in a abandoned warehouse and as soon as the car starts he calls back Matt as well as the Sheriff's department back to downtown.

Maitland wants Matt and TianaM to go to this place, to meet and have fun but when the Sheriff's department arrives they get told that a police person, Sheriff Don Davis, has asked them to take care of some
