I don't know which version it's used in. I don't know if it's in the movie or not.

All the above

I am a guy who really needs an explanation, not just a guide to movie trivia but also a guide to every little movie in existence.

But first a little note:

It was originally supposed to be a movie directed by A New Girl starring Michael Caine and Nicole Kidman.

So no, this wasn't an episode directed by Caine.

It was really a big movie movie. And I'm a movie actor for the record.

But then there's really no way of telling if you're watching a movie directed by Caine just because he directed The Wolf of Wall Street (2008/2009/2010) by Steven Spielberg. If you watch it.

And if you are, all you need to do here is find the full version and tell us why this is what it is and where it's filmed.
