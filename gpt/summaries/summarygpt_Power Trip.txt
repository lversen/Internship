After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Power Trip #1, Power Trip #2 and Power Trip and it's opening credits. I would like to take this to mean that my brain was able to process all the characters and have the final scene with the main characters. In order to do so it used all parts of my brain.

(1) "He wanted a place where he could go on a journey of discovery that would bring out the world he loves."

(2) "He really loved the fact that one day one day, you wake up with a real feeling of being at home, of being a kid in a new world. And he was obsessed about that and couldn't ignore it."

(3) "I saw this movie and it was like I was standing in the middle of that space and it was just a vision. It seemed so like I would just see that. And I was at that very moment, when I could see the kind of world that is a little bit scary to me. But it was a lighthearted movie, because he didn't want to come home to a lot of people. He was just like he was going to give it your head up, that he was going to give it everything."
