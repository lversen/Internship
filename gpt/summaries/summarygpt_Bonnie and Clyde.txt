After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Bonnie and Clyde. I'm sure, it's interesting, and I hope you all can forgive me for skipping things in there in general, because I'm just so proud of it.

And, I'll admit, I was wondering, just why he wasn't on the list. I thought I'd get on it on the first page, but I was just trying to save some time.

The movie premiered May 11 for just $12.99 on Viacom, which I was very happy about. If you're not sure which movie you want to watch for free, we're also offering a free 20% discount on the DVD of that film on the VIA DVD store.

Also, get one day free access to The Shining from here on out and get a one-time pass on our new podcast, The Shining and Why the Movie Isn't Over.

Also, on that note: The Shining will open on June 3rd, in theaters nationwide and I'm planning a special special party on June 2 for all the fans at the theater. You won't be alone.
