After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Elephant Man (1995) by John Galt, Jack Vance, Tom Wolfe, Don DeLillo, Michael Moore, Steve Fonda, Tom Selleck, Scott Rudin with Joe Sacco, and the title "The Elephant Man at Home" which starts by stating what would become "Inch by Inch" with the introduction of the music, the scene was "I'm not too happy about this moment, I'm so over it" but the movie is still not well appreciated by many.

I am a huge fan of this theme even though it is my personal favorite, for many reasons. Because it's a great adaptation of the popular book The Bear's Tale and because when you compare to the original it still falls outside the established cinematic canon (as I read this review the other day I was able to see that the movie is NOT a short story or an adventure with action).

I had the option to check this movie and be shocked if it became anything other than a great adaptation of the famous book. This is a movie with many interesting characters that have played major roles in the movie and many of which have made their own good movies (Hilary Duff, Jack Vance, John Wayne, Chuck Norris, and many more).

And I am very happy with this movie too. I would just like to emphasize one thing with the plot: that The Elephant Man is an adult story. The movie is about a teenager named Michael. Michael is a very special person. He is born with a special destiny and is about to give birth to his child. In his early childhood the little boy, he asks only to learn by doing and he learns from his mistakes. Michael takes the step that he must to fulfill his destiny and his mission to return after a failed attempt at human intervention. This scene in The Elephant Man has a fantastic character arc. Throughout he seems to be trying to meet his destiny and do the right thing and he seems like he could become a good human.

I was so surprised when I read this review that this is not a very well written film. If you will pardon me, I am saying this review is completely biased, and even though it is a well written movie it is NOT the one that best captures the greatness of this story. It is as if it were written by someone who knows how to write good literature. I do hope that it's another enjoyable one. Because this is NOT a movie to be spoiled or disappointed in. This is for YOU.

Overall Rating: 4.5/5
