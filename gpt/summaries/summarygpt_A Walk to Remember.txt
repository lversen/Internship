After this input give a synopsis of this movie: A Walk to Remember, to be shot by director Bill O'Reilly, in which a man named Joe is trying to change the destiny of his brother, who has survived a traumatic death while growing up.

The film, directed by and starring John L. Barrowman is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is ravaged by radiation, disease, death: a scenario that would make L.A. a "safe haven" for extraterrestrial visitors. In this fictional country, Joe is a scientist, and he doesn't realize that an alien civilization has been born to rule it. Because the alien civilization does not give Joe enough credit to work, he is allowed to work one more time to become a scientist. In some versions of the story, Joe's attempts to become a scientist do not fail, but when he gets tired of being given more money, he becomes cynical of his chances and lets the alien civilization take over.

In some versions of the story, Joe's attempts to become a scientist do not fail, but when he gets tired of being given more money, he loses the ability to sense his surroundings. In the movie, O'Reilly is clearly the most experienced director in Hollywood, having received over $1 billion over the years including most of this movie. The movie's score is by Phil Collins. It doesn't really make much sense to use "Lobster King."
