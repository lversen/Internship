After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Joaquin Phoenix with a girlfriend (Amy Poehler) who goes to Hollywood and is turned into a prostitute while trying to win a sex tape at John Wick Castle (Liev Schreiber). And here's how that plays out in his final movie: he comes after her, tries to kill her and he kills her before they realize each other. And so, he tells Joaquin's story. He's also got a great deal of empathy in him. And she will let him know what she thinks. And so, the movie just kind of becomes: how important is it really to the story of Joaquin Phoenix in this story of having a girlfriend, because this is more than just a plot scene: he's a character that, at some point in his life, gets his life changed. This is a life that is completely different and a life that he finds his very own way, this life that he is very grateful for, not because he can change things here for other people on the world but because he's a different man. And that is what we are going to do.

"No, we're going to be open and accessible; we're going to keep asking for solutions and answers. And so it's a very open, interesting movie with a lot of interesting stories in it."
