After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Key Largo: "For all it costliest in terms of budget, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is an emotional, unforgettable piece of cinema that could probably be remade every time a director wants to. Even though it's a story about a man trapped in a world where technology has become totally new to humanity, that is the story that the crew finds out about as they discover that his time is numbered. For an old-fashioned Trek movie that has been adapted into something like three films, it's a great move."

The idea that our brains evolved to focus only on the actions of the actors who make these connections to each other, is the main idea behind this movie's original star, James T. Kirk. (The film's directors and producers also say a lot about Kirk and the way we got to know him and what he saw as his best qualities before he died.)

"Star Trek will take us to another future where technology has replaced our normal lives with a more special kind of human existence," says Michael Rauch, senior vice president of The Walt Disney Studio Group. "This new universe will have people who are more like our own selves in every sense. A new version of us will join the starship Enterprise on Earth. This means that it will take us back in time, with Spock as Picard's brother, after the events of Star Trek's third and final act."

In it, Kirk's character in the first two Star Trek films is portrayed like a real-life Klingon named Talos, played by Richard Donner.

Kirk has a long legacy, from the classic series to the epic story arc that culminated in "Yesterday's Enterprise" to a direct-to-DVD adaptation. This new universe was first hinted at by director J.J. Abrams, but also reemerged before the first one was even released in 2006, after a huge fan outcry against the film's controversial cast.

After all, T. Kirk was originally told he was going to be a starship captain in "Last Man Standing," which would return in the third film. But for fans, that didn't go away. Not only did Paramount try to build Star Trek into two different films in the years before any of the directors went down to rejoin the franchise (like the new franchise's original star, Robert Redford), T. Kirk's performance also reared its head and fans jumped into it.

The Star Trek universe has been a subject of renewed interest since it first aired in 2008, and fans are beginning to realize the importance of making our experiences with Star Trek enjoyable when the series is seen in theaters.

Since then, critics and critics alike have taken issue with what's been called the most "fanatical viewing experience" of all time, which is what Star Trek's audience looks like in order to see what happens after a movie comes out. Some moviegoers have complained that critics refuse to give Star Trek a fair and adequate review, while the most recently heard controversy over Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan may offer clues.

The Star Trek universe itself isn't as much a fanfest as it was when it first debuted as a series on television, but that's just because the franchise has grown more successful over the years. (Remember when Star Trek's first "Star Trek spinoff," "The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages," debuted on television? Well, this year's reboot is a different story.)

The original Star Trek trilogy has never seen an actual TV commercial and there have been no original series for more than one show that has tried and failed. So even though T. Kirk has the rare advantage of being a character who has made it to the next big hit installment, there is one piece of entertainment that has stuck with Star Trek fans for so long.

A long time ago, a television series, a movie or a television series about the Klingon Empire had never happened. Then on Jan. 22, 2009, the first broadcast series of "Star Trek" started airing in the United States and Canadian markets and the cast for "Star Trek II:" The Wrath of Khan, a series featuring the Klingon Empire's main antagonist, Mecar. There was no original "Star Trek" series to begin with.

And the show wasn't on TV for four and a half years.

In 2011, the second half of "Star Trek" was rebooted by the very same studio that originally gave the series an early run on television in 2003. The show was later rebooted in 2007, followed by "The Next Generation" in 2008, "The Next Generation" in 2009, "Journey into Mystery" in 2011 and "The Last Exodus" in 2014. (The first Trek reboot was released on DVD, as is the second reboot.)

Of course, the original series was meant
