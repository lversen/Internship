After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Dumbo on the Beach Vol. 2 (1998): "From what I think of him, in comparison with his fellow members he gets some great things out of them." (Terence Trent Jameson, The Hollywood Reporter, September 30, 1994, p. 5) Dumbo in this film is the first person known in Hollywood to openly admit that he is gay or bisexual without giving his full name. There is also a brief interview on film "Hollywood's No. 1 Good Guy" about this aspect of him and about two other gay actors to whom his public disclosure is due. If it's possible for Dumbo to be bisexual because he doesn't need to tell his full name and doesn't want it considered by any other actor, that would be a legitimate issue that everyone would pursue. The movie contains a great deal of dialogue between Dumbo and other members of the cast who openly admit to his sexual orientation. In these interviews both gay actors can attest that they were "stubborn with their gayness" by the late 1980's and early 1990's, leading to the decision of the Director and producer, to allow homosexuality in the casting of films. These interviews were made on the following date: July 16, 1983, at the New York Film Critics Association Awards for Best Feature Feature Film.

– The first time Dumbo met a gay actor, his voice rang out loud in his voice in the voice recording of the interview. (The Hollywood Reporter, May 6, 1993)

– The two other gay actors and the director of this documentary were also present at the awards ceremony, the other two were members of our own cast. (The Hollywood Reporter, September 12, 1993) In this interview, the director stated that he thinks of gay actors when he says, "I am not the actor who you think of when you think of myself. I am not a homosexual. I am not a bisexual. I am bisexual. I am bisexual." ("Riverside Massacre", film review, Dec. 3, 1994)

– I am not a member of this group. The film, "Hollywood's No. 1 Good Guy," features several gay actors, including a couple actor at age 25. They are all actors who express their sexual feelings to the director because they are gay (including myself). ("Stromberg and the Lion" and "The Hollywood Reporter, 2003, May 25, 2003) It is a great idea for us [those who] have grown up in the gay community and who are now beginning to express their sexuality openly, to take our sexuality public and ask for our support – and that's what we're offering." (The Hollywood Reporter, October 11, 1989)
