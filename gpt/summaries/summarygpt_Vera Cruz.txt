After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Vera Cruz's "I'm a Lesbian Lesbian", a well-known example as far as I am concerned.


The first time I watched "Love Story", I was still reading, although my brain was completely at ease with the book, the movie's plot and plot points. It had taken me years of reading several other books on queer/straight love and sex, and I wasn't able to take this into the larger picture.

Now "Love Story" has gone into its first year of release.

The first thing about this film is its strong female, feminist, queer/transgender character, played by Jessica Chastain.

Jessica does not shy away from being a good friend, and the film has inspired many people over the years, as I've written here, even without mentioning it.

In reality, Chastain is a self-proclaimed lesbian by birth, and the result of a long, rocky childhood, all stemming from having to navigate with her sexuality.

Jessica has always been outspoken about her queer identity and her own commitment to it, which she felt was completely and utterly inappropriate to anyone outside of Hollywood.

After discovering her own sexuality before the film was released, Chastain came out as bisexual and transitioned out of this personal situation. When things were brought to a head, however, when the movie finally wrapped, Chastain publicly admitted that she was bisexual and it was her fault. Chastain told everyone that she loved men, and she has since become a huge feminist campaigner for equality.

While a lot of people say that Jessica chalks up her sexuality to being a big man to her parents, she was forced to admit that she came out after being sexually abused and abused by the same man for more than 20 years, and since those things were just too much for an adult woman to handle.

She was told that her identity, what it was she was truly expressing, and where she went from there, was her own.

In her autobiography, "My Secret Story" Chastain talks to how her childhood (and adolescence), during her earliest years as a girl, inspired her to change her sexual orientation before taking a private therapist appointment.

Being an individual, she would say things like "You are not going to change your name without some kind of counseling you told me before I came out of my mind."

In this way Chastain became who she desired to be, she would tell people what it would take to get a job which was an affirming and loving experience, and she could not have been more different from every other person, even though she was already a woman. She went through a number of life adversities, but as a person she would never have believed that it would take for someone like me and an LGBT person like her to come out, so to speak, without such support and support, it would never have occurred to her that she would have to put her own life at risk or find another job.


After the film wrapped, Chastain expressed that she was so sorry that she was unable to get the job she desired, but was thankful that she could get it so much less. She said that she felt as though she was being persecuted by Hollywood, and believed that they really could not be more fair to every lesbian, or all lesbian women regardless of their orientation.

Now, after reading a number of positive comments that have been made about the film, it should be pointed out, that the only people who are getting that support at all, the queer/transgender woman, are the movie's producers and directors, who were heavily involved on this project.

As I noted on the credits to this film, Chastain's sexuality has come back down slowly as she comes out, finally realizing her true self. She doesn't feel like a man until she begins to become bisexual, and never goes back to being a man until she was sexually abused by a former partner.

You may recall that Chastain's character would have a gay and bisexual love interest, but the movie actually allows that relationship from the start. She had to transition out of the bisexual relationship to a love interest, and not because it was too much to do with women or sexuality.

This story is also the only one of the films that actually tells the story of "the love story," and while she was originally bisexual before this, it took a long time for her to find herself in love with men.

Instead of telling the story of the romantic love story at the very moment she became a lesbian, Chastain tells the story of her own past. One of Chastain's greatest strengths was that she was fully transparent that she was still a woman, but also to her friends she wasn't a man, and what
