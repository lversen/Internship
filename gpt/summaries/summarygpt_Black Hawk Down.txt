After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Black Hawk Down is an epic action thriller starring Clint Eastwood and Tom Hardy. It's based on the novel by the renowned screenwriter David Niven who also produced Justice League: The Golden State and the film by Kevin Smith (Rome). This movie is highly praised by critics. However this is not the first time that the film had a poor performance at the box office in 2005 and despite strong reviews from the critics it wasn't on the list at the time. It's also very bad in the same way as Thunderdome. No plot points or character development are left intact which makes it very difficult to recommend it. However despite these criticisms, I think a high score on The Hollywood Reporter with 2 out of the 3 Oscar for Best Animated Feature will win fans over.

The movie comes at a very interesting time for DC Entertainment. The movies they make are not the ones you might not expect and they have no real stars or action in any of the supporting actors who makes these movies special. The big question is when will DC bring back the same characters I know and love? Not only is there no way to make a movie with these supporting characters, they can not do anything that makes them memorable for any reason and every movie of this world has the potential to come apart at any point in its existence. DC has a strong cast already but this would seem to leave them without a strong star.

One of my main criticisms of Justice League is that they mostly rely on using characters who are old or in their forties. The movie doesn't have that problem. The new DC hero is much more interesting to work with than his predecessors who have yet to gain even a passing familiarity with him. They actually use an excellent director who is both great and competent. The new Justice League doesn't really have a story or a plot that does not rely on a ton of CGI. It is just a little bit clunky and is just too slow to make sense out of it. For a movie as diverse as Justice League, this is especially odd given this makes you wonder if it was really a small team of heroes that were the first to see a screen in the first place.

Despite all this, the movie succeeds at two very different things. The first is in its handling of the characters that they have brought in. Justice League seems to go from getting a good cast to working with all the new actors, and the movie has a very good story that keeps them coming back. The second problem is its pacing. Justice League takes almost 2 hrs and 60 min to make. It's only a 5 min and 4 hr long movie and the pacing is just too slow. This makes for a very difficult movie, especially on a day I can't afford to pay for my subscription or if I was an older person. I'm not one of those people that will watch a movie like this and I am very disappointed with the movie. There is something lacking in the movie that I don't mind. Justice League is a really good movie for a lot of different reasons. If you enjoy the movie and if you love a movie like this it is going to be sure to enjoy this one.

Justice League has really changed the way I approach movies. I can be critical of directors like Frank Miller and his work but still find the tone and structure of these movies and this movie as the biggest contender. That could be another 4 years, but it has always been about the same thing. I would say it deserves a 7 or 8.

The first trailer was released on May 24th, 2015 and it was amazing for me. It seemed like a lot of people could see through this movie, that it was made in 2012 and 2013, that it was not only meant to be adapted, but to be adapted into its third and final movie. I actually went to the movie on the movie train at the same event and watched the first trailer as I was about to go to LA to see Justice League. Then the people who came by seemed to give out an enthusiastic glowing reception. I was really impressed so much that it was like a film that had taken me back to the original comics.

The movie has been a revelation and I cannot wait for it to be in theaters with me in July. It is an absolute must see on YouTube so I must say I am very happy with it! This movie does not disappoint and I very much need to see it to appreciate the difference in movie made by different directors
