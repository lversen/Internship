After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Ed Wood, Kevin Smith (Johanna Bellow), George Clooney ("He Who Cares To Be Heard"), Mark Ruffalo ("Harrison Ford and Michael Cera").

3.8.1 If watching "Downton Abbey" doesn't cause you to be more excited, you should watch "Shining in the Dark," a remake of the novel by Stephen King.

3.8.2 This film, like all the other novels, focuses on women. Its characters, including one-time British spy Sally Field, are described in terms of the dark and scary. Also in the film, there are white women who have long hair and are often referred to as white. These characteristics were recently revealed in a number of contemporary novels.

3.8.3 If you're not a huge Star Wars fan, "Titanic" can be a daunting experience to watch if you're not a lifelong fan. However, this was a well-financed adaptation in a relatively small universe, so you'll be able to follow your interests and find it exciting.

3.8.4 Here are a few theories on what might have happened if that movie had been a success.

3.8.5 While much has changed in the two centuries since the original publication of "Star Trek" and subsequent sequels, there are signs of life in the present. Star Trek's initial television series, "A New Hope," is still getting the most attention. It was released in 1968. Today, "Titanic" remains an interesting series with a wide cast and fan base, but there is little new information in the series's pages.

3.8.6 In short, don't expect to have "Titanic" to be the first Trek movie to include a women character. The main female character, Sarah Archer (played by Joan Plummer), is a woman who has become a main star in television history, but is not in any way as much of a fan of her husband as he did. Even though she was one of the first female characters to be played by the Star Trek director Robert Picardo, her character remained an obscure character on the American screen. In a letter from 2003 to a friend and later to various sources, actor John Williams said that, "I really don't see the Star Trek movies as anything but a fun, fun, kind-of thing to be a part of (unless, of course, there was a lot of other Star Trek characters to play). This is something the writers of the original series could put together."

3.8.7 "Tiger Princess" follows Diana as she attempts to escape captivity by attempting to build her own ship from scratch using donated water, and to raise money for her own rescue of stranded princesses. She is followed by Captain Nemo ("Nadine Williams"), who is an extremely charming, brilliant, powerful, and very different character from Diana as a person.

3.8.8 Another thing to keep in mind is the direction that the film would take the characters. The first three episodes of the film (which all star Diana) focus on Diana trying to build her own ship, while the last few episodes focus on the main characters' personal lives being built up through the movie while trying to build one for herself. But while "Logan" focuses on "Mad Max" or the "Powers Unleashed" franchise, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is focused on "Star Trek"; both franchises are centered on the series.

3.8.9 "The Day The Earth Stood Still" is set in the future. After the fall of the Klingon Empire, the United States military invaded Earth and became involved in the colonization of the planet. After seeing the Federation and various nations fall into civil war, Starfleet sends the USS San Francisco to investigate their situation. The day their ship arrives, the USS Discovery enters battle with the starship Enterprise. While the Enterprise and the Enterprise's crew are trying to defend the Federation, a massive group of survivors try to escape Earth and face off against Earth's Federation Forces. One of the survivors is Sisko, who has been sent to the Enterprise to help save his family from destruction. Sisko, with help from his Vulcan brothers, tries to save the remaining survivors. There are also references to a lot of other characters from "Star Trek," just as a lot of TV series: "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is an alternate reality, while "Transformers: Age of Extinction" was an alternate reality animated series produced by Paramount, Disney, and CBS in the US. Also, in "The Day The Earth Stood Still," the ship of a planet from "Star Trek" is the Enterprise, but there is also an alien ship that appears to be from the same galaxy.
