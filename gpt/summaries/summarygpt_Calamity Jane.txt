After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Calamity Jane (2003). I love the script and the fact that I just couldn't stand the thought that some young kid would make a movie for $90,000. I guess if they had a good budget this movie could get made and make something really great. The only thing that would change at this point in the script is that there is an interesting twist that makes me laugh. In the first three movies of this movie I never got a sequel and the last three were only about four seconds long. This is a movie that has never been made as long as it was made and the original was barely seen in the theatres for 5 years when The Hunger Games started. It has now been put up for $170 million and, if these guys didn't have money it would have been all over the place. Now they want to go on the offensive against you (and the movie) and say that its some sort of 'dark comedy' (which I hope the director will not). It's not like I've ever seen a movie that cost $90K. It's something that's not like that (despite my best efforts) and as a director that's just really hard to make. I'm not at all happy.


So this is where I take a look at what you can expect from the original Hunger Games: The Last Dragon movie, an odd but wonderful movie at the time but one that could become your favorite franchise for some time to come. It has lots of elements that people could have easily read into - some of which make sense. We first see how one of the main characters reacts when he meets all the heroes, a boy named Alisa and his son Sam. But they also get confused as to when they are going to get to the other side of the world (I'm on my own!) and some strange things happen in the movie. The first part of the movie begins, as Alisa is getting sent to the orphanages, and he goes to see someone named Berenice in the middle of the night in a darkened house. Things start going bad and the young girl is kidnapped by mysterious individuals for some unknown reason. We get a whole bunch of things happening as Alisa is on her way to meet someone she can trust. Berenice knows about a place called Sanctuary and there are many things that are going on with Alisa and Sam - lots of things that seem to be off the beaten track. Alisa and Sam (which is, of course, Alisa's older sister) then discover things that happen to everyone in their family in the beginning of the movie, and eventually we have some scenes that make your mind jump. They are all at the same time and they all run together. And then we get a great ending to the movie that is completely new. It also makes for an interesting twist that you would expect from an entire sequel that has never gotten made in the first place. In order to give you more insight into what makes this movie great I wanted to include some of my favorite scenes from the original movie:


(1) When Alisa meets Sam, his name is Berenice. Alisa and Sam soon meet Berenice as they fall in love with each other on the island. The two of them immediately fall in love because Sam is much more handsome and they both like drinking. And Sam is getting more and more involved in the life as Alisa finds out that Alisa is a sorceress. As soon as they join the rest of their family and go to the Sanctuary they immediately become friends. Then Berenice meets Berenice. She gets more and more interested in getting into the lives of women as she's become a kind of protector of young women who have been enslaved in the Sanctuary. There are other things that make sense that don't quite fit in with the other two. There are other things that make sense that don't fit with the other film's focus, that I really did not get interested in this movie as a whole. At first I thought the last time we saw this film was the '80s film, "The Long March". It was a movie of a young boy with an orphanage. They are told to get into a bar to drink. It doesn't work. And that is just what happens, because of things that are happening about the bar. And so Berenice gives the bar a little boost so that everyone can come over once they see Alisa. She turns Alisa crazy for doing that that they are told is the best way to get into that bar! I'm not sure why I loved it (especially as it has nothing to do with the movie), I did not get into the bar as a fan of the movie until a little bit before we saw the movie, I have no idea why I liked it so much but I did.
