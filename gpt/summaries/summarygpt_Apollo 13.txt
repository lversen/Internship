After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Apollo 13: An American Mystery.

The synopsis reads as follows:

Sometime during Apollo 13, a group of young astronauts (some of whom were aliens or extraterrestrials) discovers that they are not alone, and when their arrival is made known, all hell breaks loose. Written by Christopher Lee and directed by Tony Gilroy, the movie sets down Apollo 13 as a perfect storm - a perfect night in the movie for fans as well as for critics. If you love '70s teen fare, you'll love '70s action. As Apollo 13 is so far from the future, why not let you experience that dream in front of your big screen?"

Here's Star-Wizard.com contributing editor Jonathan Culp's report on this review:

It's about a boy who goes to a bar and goes up to see a friend, and he sees people out there with strange things going on. He and the boy get knocked into the sky in an unknown city, and are knocked to the ground. They run out and find an astronaut in his space suit. A moment later, the boy and the man have to come up with a way to get him to come up with these amazing ideas. One of those ideas is the idea of the Moon. (For better or worse, there are no official words.) "What you're hearing about [the] Moon is very unusual. It would just be unusual for any other celestial body," the writer said.

But Apollo 13 is much like the Moon.

Star-Wizard.com reporting:

A story by Michael Chico (Michael Chico) is in the news right now. And he has been a guest contributor for The New Yorker's "Out of This World." According to The New Yorker, Chico wrote

"This story is being billed as the first to put up a story in its entirety, based entirely on the premise that mankind's first astronauts were actually aliens. In fact, Chico is the kind of guy who wrote a book so famous when it first came out that its sales would go up and that some of its best-selling stories actually got written."

The movie has received a lot of critical and online attention for giving a little bit of real life to a short space adventure. Most reviewers praise its visual tone and some claim the movie is pretty cool too. Also, it's a small movie based off a screenplay by Mark Twain. It was shot in the '40s, the day after the end of the world, and has an almost futuristic look.
