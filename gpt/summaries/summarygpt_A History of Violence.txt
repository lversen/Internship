The first part of the prologue was written by Dr. Thomas A. Kline, and covers the introduction story. The second half was written by Robert E. Howard. The last part of the prologue takes the reader between five and six minutes to read the entire book. The main topic of the prologue reads, "The first major civil war happened in 1890, when men from over 50 states took part in the Civil War. It was against the wishes of the majority of men in America. At this time, the war had raged on for several years. A new government called the "War Cabinet" was led by Governor Frederick E. Jackson. The war was about to start for almost four years. Over the next three months, American civil war organizations were coming together in order to take control of the government, and the first war was called Offutt. General Grant organized the entire civil conflict. At one point in this conflict, General Alexander Taylor, a German lieutenant under Napoleon, was killed in a gun battle while attempting to take the German prisoner of war which then spread to the rest of Europe. The war was so violent that General Grant made his famous speech, "I had no right to send my men to kill Americans if they came to me with no help." It's true that the generals of the other countries were so opposed, and they ordered that General Taylor would be made General American. After a year of such a declaration and declaration of war, the American population had to turn on each other and surrender. This was done using the Army as a base. But they were not able to stand up and make many peace proposals. The war started on January 21st, 1891 when President Roosevelt said that the government would be called off. One day after that, General Grant sent a message in advance. This was said to be the first real peace offer he had seen for the war. However, it was not to be. In June, an army of 6,000 troops were sent under the direction of General Alexander Taylor and then, with a series of heavy bombing during the month of July, came under the command of General Taylor. They bombed two villages in the British Isles and their base was raided. The first was bombed. As the last bombing failed to stop Taylor's forces from opening fire on the insurgents. As the fighting continued, he ordered the war to end as the soldiers were wounded. The other town in which the war ended was called Kettera. The town had been captured on July 7th, and since then the war had raged, and the American people have been living under a false government that they have been living under ever since. After their defeat in Kettera, and while the soldiers tried to negotiate a surrender for their lives on July 18, 1892, the Army of 12,087 soldiers (16 soldiers each) came under General Taylor's control. This led to an army of 7,000 soldiers that fought from January 1st, 1894 until June 28th, 1897. The last war fought for the American people occurred on May 2nd, 1898. The American people were fighting over $300 million dollars and we have now officially officially stated that it was the Civil War. We will never forget this day and that.
