After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Crazy Heart & Magic - 3-DVD.

As the title indicates, the first part contains the following lines:

"One thing you all know is that you have to do everything. Everything. Everything. That you can't do. That you can't do. That you can't do. You can't leave the house you're in. You can't. It's just a game. A game to play. And it has to be fun. Because, let's face it, it has to be fun. As I understand it, it has to be fun. So, you know like, no, that's about it. It's a game. That's about it. So, it has to be fun. And now you know the game!

And now, because of some strange, unexpected thing, but as a matter of fact, I think I'm going to share this with you. So, if this isn't true, then what were you thinking when thinking about this movie?

We're talking about it because the final scene of the movie isn't just a prologue. It actually comes after the scene in which we watch the movie in full. That is, it's just a prologue. And when you think about it, it is not just a prologue. It's also a very, very important part of the story.

You may remember from my interview with Mandy about these things when I said, like, "So I see these guys, and how they play together." Well, the story in the last act is the entire team. It's kind of the whole team, just the team of these guys, but it's also a completely different story. And it's what the movie itself is. At the same time, they have to try on their hair because, you know, we were like in this scene of like, 'Ah, we're not ready as actors for that anymore.'

You know, that scene, you know? It's really so important to the rest of the crew. It's just, it's the story. It's like, and we all know it's true. We all knew it was true, but we thought about why we wouldn't do it. So, to all of them who said, 'Dude, we're not ready.' That's how it is… I don't know. What was all that about it for such a long time? Because that's like some kind of plot point and you're like, 'What? We're waiting for something?'

In other words, you have to say that one sentence at a time. The movie is kind of one person's idea for making something. That said, in the final moments of the movie, when all this gets in the way of doing something and you're like 'Okay, well, then let's just start again.' The idea, you know? We're doing well. We're doing really, really well.

So, the movie really brings you into the world, you know? It's the main story. So I think it's a pretty good point of view. As someone who is a strong, hard-working person. So, this is what it's like to be there in this world, watching some guys who didn't go through this kind of stuff. I mean, even the guys who had their struggles don't necessarily have the same struggle, and it doesn't feel the same. (laughs) And then you realize that you're watching a really, really good movie.

That's what happens with these guys, they're all real heroes. Every one of them was a real, really bad guy.

But what really separates the movie is how much the movie actually has you see.

Well, it's like you know… when the final scene starts, it's like, oh… a part of me has this sudden insight about this kind of guy who would probably be better off if he wasn't so horrible. A part of me has something just like a lot more to say. I just remember that moment when I heard Mandy was talking about this guy, and that was just kind of the first of many, many conversations I would come face to face with. Because, you know, if I have to make two quick predictions, one would be "He's gonna get hurt," and that wouldn't happen. The other would be, you know, it would happen. Just sort of this kind of, all of these different things where they're like, 'Okay, well, you never really had to think in terms of, 'Well, I guess I'm gonna have to do this.'" So you know, there's really nothing left in this part of you that says, 'OK, fine.' "Yeah.
