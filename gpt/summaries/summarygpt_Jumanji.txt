After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle - An Indian Journey to Finding Nemo - A Journey Into Mystery - The Story of A.I. - Sushi - The Odyssey. In other words, if you're like me, you probably think you'll be able to enjoy this movie in that way as well, but I think that its already too far for some of you. So, this movie is much too late to enjoy this movie, just because of me in the box office and the movie being too far in advance of it. I guess I can just ignore this for now:
I have to agree: this will be my favorite movie of 2016, I still am very happy watching it, so I'll never stop enjoying it for the rest of the year and for as long as it lasts.
You can now get the movie Blu-ray in November at box office on BluMovies.
