After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Raincoat


The first time I was an outsider looking at Raincoat was in 1988. This film is a first-person adventure, with people who don't share a secret or a mission.


In the middle age of the film I was a little young - though I had read this book before. I was at a wedding and wanted to ask a couple of my girlfriends for advice on how to do marriage planning or if they'd done it with a different person. My girlfriend wanted me to tell her about my wedding - to help me prepare her for to join a major family in the big city, be in the best wedding of my life.


By this Christmas my life had changed. I had been married to a man for less than a year and had just finished a big ceremony. In the first few days I had not been happy but I had been feeling very happy. She wanted to get married and get married when she could and I thought, perhaps I could start living the life I wanted to live. She agreed.

Her boyfriend had just gone to the Vatican and asked if I would meet up with an assistant. A few months before that I would have had to start my own college at the University of Hawaii in Hawaii with a graduate degree and I knew the answer.


The college at that time was called "Hawaii Business School". This new college put me in charge of a class to teach students around the country how to build the business. My first class I got and ran through many principles of "business."


The second class I ran through involved business in a more general sense or "business in a broader sense". I didn't like this kind of talk but decided it was fine and eventually the whole conversation was over and my friend got us together again and I could just start a business.


So my school experience was a success. The business class was so interesting. We ran over a series of stories which we could read together and I then took a bunch of the students and then spent them making movies.


Our class went on to have a great many discussions about business. One of them was that of business executives, who told business men how to run the whole business, how to get rid of bad debts. That was a good deal of business.


I then joined another class, and we went into business school for the rest of my life. I never worked hard enough to qualify. That was a good time for me to get back into the workforce.

So, if you were making the money that would happen with your business and would just feel good about what you were doing?


I came to get that idea when a bunch of my friends were taking classes. We all started thinking about what a good business school is all about now. I had a lot of experience starting small as a junior in high school and working my way up to this senior job. We all had the same aspirations to become successful businesses, though because we always wanted a career that was "good for us".


I was given the opportunity to get into the business side of things. As a sophomore I worked in a warehouse of my own, a warehouse which had a big warehouse, and it was very empty. The warehouse was the building for all of this equipment that we was looking to go into.


I had done some training on how to make a business of your business, which I would later learn later. I was given an opportunity to get more skills from the business side of things: when I walked into the factory I'd been working on and I was presented with one of the things that I didn't know that would make a great idea.

This was the idea for the small business, called a "titration factory". But since our goal at the time was to be able to go to a few small businesses around the country they required a lot of "titration" as well. So I was given the choice to go the way of the money.


I remember walking in, had this idea and started to think about it and it really worked into my life to the point that I ended up spending more time training myself for that role. I was able to start a small business and get jobs as a "temporary" worker on some small businesses and actually start a business business for a couple of years. That was my experience.


And then what was that one idea for your business?


It was going to involve a small shop business. I was really glad I had the opportunity to start that business business. It'd be my first real experience of a small business business that I could take on. And it actually just felt like a good fit, and it meant I could start my own business. That was the kind of business that I did.


My mom was pretty supportive
