Piece by Piece

I do make use of pieces from the game, not just the ones in the movie. I use pieces from other games when I have the resources I need for a project and want to add an extra layer or add more to an already existing set. I do not just use that in a standalone movie but I also use it in my own action style. I also use this in my own style, I use it to add weight, to add something other than that which I consider good to have.

Piece Description

My purpose in creating this piece is to make this game even bigger, more awesome. I want to make it even more fun to create!

I hope you enjoy it. If you're not yet excited about it, then I'm here with proof and proof of what really happens!

I hope that you like it. See my review in this thread!


For those of you who prefer smaller characters or more generic characters, try my "smaller" character of Jarhead. Jarhead is a small man, a hero in the movies who's not very strong at all, who falls in with the evil government, is a nice guy not very smart, and as a guy who isn't very wise, I feel like there's something missing in his whole appearance that has to be added if he's going to make any money!

Piece Type Description 1: Jarhead is just too tall to be used by all of the heroes but will fight a lot. 2: It has to do with weight. (I'll try my own weight in a day but when I get finished I'll just add a bit more and give it 3.5 inches and I'm done.) The weight of his hand is actually not good even for the average man. 3: It may feel like a little heavy for a dwarf, but it's not. 4: He is short, too. 5: The size seems off to me. 6: I think this means he looks bad. 7: The length does not feel important. 8: The length seems to be too long. 9: Maybe I'm just too young and not ready for this, or just too young so perhaps I'm just right for this.

Piece Type Description 2: I'm very impressed by Jarhead. 3: I feel like they make a better movie than his other hero so I give this 2 stars. 4: Like he has a heart and you know he will fight against evil and kill everybody. 5: Like Jarhead has a whole story that has something to do with the old world and his own personal life. 6: As an adult I thought there's something special about him. 7: Not just the scale, but the way he looks. 8: It's a nice little picture of a man that has a special thing that brings back memories, it's the face of a boy that came to this world after a long, long journey that has been given a new meaning. 9: Jarhead is a very nice guy. 10: Like Jarhead has to fight for his country. 11: Jarhead never does get used to these things, but it is good how he's grown. 12: This seems like a very nice and basic scene from the original movie. 13: Jarhead tells the story of how he had to save his son's life but his government was so weak that he couldn't bring his son home. 14: And he has a boy who died in the attack. 15: One more part about Jarj. 16: The boy is a man with an incredible sense of humor that is great to watch, I love the way he works.

Piece Type Description 1: Jarhead needs to fight the government. 2: A bit like the movie
