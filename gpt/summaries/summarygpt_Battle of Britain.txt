Star Wars: The Force Awakens: We are a team at Disney World Shanghai, China, where we are helping to create, improve and bring life to Star Wars' fan community. We're proud to lead, innovate and push the next generation of Disney-funded, world-class entertainment that will redefine the film industry, with our game The Clone Wars.Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The story and character of Anakin Skywalker, which will be seen in The Force Awakens Episode IX, the next movie in the Galactic saga. The cast will be:The story begins in a galaxy far, far away, and where there exist billions of people with unimaginable, horrific, and unimaginable power – all of these are under the command of Anakin Skywalker – and his mission is to liberate those who hold him down! Star Wars: Jedi The Jedi is a game in which players take control of all five hundred years old, and take their roles as the Jedi in The Force Awakens to change the course of history and the galaxy within them.Star Wars: Jedi The Jedi will consist of two single-player campaigns, each with a distinct narrative twist. Players take control of two different Jedi Knight, one of whom is trained by Anakin Skywalker to become the second in power, one of whom is named in The Clone War and the other by the name of Jedi Master R2-D2, who in turn takes on as his Master the Jedi Master R2-D2 of the Jedi Order.

Star Wars players who have made the trek to China needn't worry: They will have the opportunity to try out any of the new experiences included with The Clone Wars Game.

As of right now, only backers who have already sent us campaign and have received them via email will be able to purchase the game with the new campaign features.

However, we are excited to announce some more details about The Clone Wars Game on our official Facebook page on the day after the release of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, the next game launched on April 12th.

With this in mind we have decided to release a new level of excitement that we wanted to make.

The only way to get to the level 1 (which means there will be four levels) that fans have not yet seen is by giving the level 1 backers a free, quick pass to The Clone Wars Game. This is available in both the physical and digital versions, and only the digital version of the game, so get ready, guys.

The basic level has many features, including 3D backgrounds, voice acting and an all new setting, The Phantom Menace (you will hear about it soon).

The digital version is also completely new, with a new music video, a new mission mode with three new levels and an extra set of rules with both classic and new scenarios.

The Digital Version also includes the original, new level 1, two new missions, 4 new weapons and gear, as well as a new campaign mode.

On top of that we also have some additional content for you just waiting to be able to see. All these items can only be obtained through your level and level pass holders (this is to ensure that we give backers every chance to get access to the game).

It seems like a lot, right?

It's not. We know it's not easy. You could try playing through any of the levels with the pre-order bonus but it would take for days and days. Once all your rewards have been received we will be making a separate website to take you back to the first tier of our backer support!

All the content is completely free to download or to play but will come with a hefty price tag for you.

Once the level has been cleared we will be posting a summary of the rewards to your Facebook page and also to the official official Facebook page.
