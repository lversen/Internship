After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Lady Vanishes (1999):

In this adaptation the women, who are all young and attractive, meet in a motel where the girls are sleeping. The hotel is in a small, dimly lit cavern and the sex is very explicit. The scenes with this particular prostitute are so explicit that we get a sense of the depth of the crime as it unfolds. The girls are constantly in love with each other, and it is this kind of love that creates these scenes. When you're an adult, there is usually no love between an adult who is interested and who is not. They are not connected, but they have an important relationship between them. We see the sex in this movie because of the character with her mouth in hand and the scene is so real and heartbreaking that the audience and the film becomes so invested in the character and the movie is no different. It's the essence of a love scene that it's very satisfying and the whole movie is about that love, both with the girls and the sex itself.


The Lady Vanishes ends with a scene of her making out, but it starts to seem like she's not exactly looking forward to it. You could actually see the sex in the movie because I couldn't see that she had turned away from the scene:


You're not alone. The American Civil Liberties Union, New York City, said their case against Vignelli, filed in 2012 in federal court, will require the movie to be included under a new classification. This year the plaintiffs, along with the National Film Board of Review, New York City, began the fight to keep the movie from being shown in movie theaters, which, if enacted is difficult to do, might mean the movie cannot be shown nationwide. The film is not available in five states, but Vignelli has appealed in five of those states, in addition to the District of Columbia. In June 2012, the Department of Justice, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, announced it would not pursue cases to deny the National Film Act's classification, citing lack of "public interest."


While we can't read too much into this case, these statements are certainly relevant, and Vignelli's character is played as a child molester in a way that makes her seem a threat to his victim - and she does not seem to be particularly interested in his sexual relationship. In fact, the "she should not engage with children," as you said by way of explaining away that she's a "pulitzer prize winning star," is also in fact a pretty extreme statement to make, given her "sexual orientation" in the first place. However, there's a good chance she won't do anything to help her victim, except stay silent, even if all she knew was "oh, that's not a nice word for an adolescent and a child." Furthermore, it would be interesting to see if Vignelli wants to be held a better role in the remake's production or if she gets more publicity from the critics rather than be an anti-gay man.

This was an early and entertaining film. In my opinion, it is a beautiful one and I would absolutely recommend it in theaters and other theaters. It was a great film and it has still to live up to its high standards.
