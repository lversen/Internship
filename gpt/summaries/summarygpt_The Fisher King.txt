After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Fisher King, The Golden Circle, The Merchant of Venice

You can tell that this movie was very different from its predecessors. For example, the original, the final, and almost all the parts on this list were all filmed on the location at least two weeks apart.

This was probably because not a single frame of this movie was captured on camera.

No frame of this movie was captured on the floor of a hotel during the filming of "The Merchant"

This was probably also due to its location.

The other two parts, The Merchant of Venice and The Golden Circle, respectively, were filmed over the same location by the same studio.

The film was recorded in a single shot and finished up before it even arrived on screen

The script was actually written for a particular story in English (which many movie fans have heard of). The exact words and ending of the script are still quite strange to any experienced movie-goer.

There were not any shots ever captured on film that turned out to be completely wrong.

The whole story itself has never been proven, yet there is one film that has that exact ending that had a very satisfying ending even after the film was released (the script was never written down until the final shot of the film).

In fact, all three major scenes of the movie were filmed at various locations at different times around the world.

Most notably, the scene where the captain of an armed force is shot in the head by a single bullet. We know this from both the Japanese and American histories of this scene.

However, this scene was actually recorded over a different spot on the ocean than the one filmed over in the first two days of filming.

Another important fact: the whole shot in the head that ended with the captain being shot actually was recorded in the same location, about 15.5 kilometers from where there was originally shot-

The two other scenes in the film were filmed at different locations and times – even though they never got filmed the only time they were filmed was during the first two days of filming (around the time after the film went out).

Thus, the time (literally) when there was originally shot actually happened in exactly the wrong place.

So, here's our take, based on historical information: the exact location of the opening and ending shots in one of the four major scenes of the movie went off the top of my head, at about 11:01 pm local time in the morning of the last day of filming (that was approximately 10:45 am Eastern time on the other side of the world during the filming that day as well).

At almost 2:30 AM the next day, on the 6th day of filming (the day when the crew did the shoot up to the top of the ocean on the 2nd day of filming of The Golden Circle), an unidentified male pilot appeared from the water. He was wearing a blue jacket, in blue light blue jumpsuit with a white t-shirt and black pants, which we know he was wearing from the first picture of the film! There is also blood and wreckage being found in the ocean floor after he was shot. We can see that he had been wearing a military outfit under the same coat for a few minutes in the last few minutes of the shooting. His helmet, which had just been removed and was now on the water for several minutes, was also worn. Then, upon returning to the boat he got a text message that he wanted "to bring you a souvenir". We know that, for everyone involved in such a large and complex incident, the official ship captains would call all the relevant people along for the trip (including his family members).

He handed back the letter, and then gave the rest of the message to the crew, which had immediately come through to take things home by the way!

But there was not as much of a difference between The Fountain of Youth and The Green Light as we think.

The green light was actually filmed in a time at which the film was actually shot on a real beach at the time of filming.

The film was shot during The Beach Zone which was an area of real ocean and was the only place on "The Golden Circle" where the shooting took place.

The actual filming location in The Fountain of Youth

I mean literally, I saw it through every aspect – on the camera the only thing missing was a large, white water sculpture on this building.

Also, the location where The Fountain of Youth had originally been filmed in

was actually a lot smaller than it was on film. I still haven't even looked at all the parts of the piece for myself!
