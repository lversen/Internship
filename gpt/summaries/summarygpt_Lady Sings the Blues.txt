After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Lady Sings the Blues; Lady Sings the Girl, the Playhouse Door Sings the Playhouse Door, and Lady Sings the Painted Boat Part II (D-II).

There is also a film called Lady In the Rain (D-II). This is a remake of Lady in the Rain, written by David Wernick. In this movie David gives the voice to the woman who calls herself Miss Dork. In a letter to Miss Dork, David asks to be a "good wife", though Miss Dork does not have much of an opinion on this issue. In the final scene of this game I have heard a rumor that the game was meant to be a parody (because the game is much more serious than that.) So I thought I would try to play it.

So. My first thought was to get a good story!

Now, because there are many "best story" in the game, I would say this game is a good game (for me). I just did not like the fact that many times I received bad reviews. And I was so bored by the game that I thought I would go back and review it again. In the end my best, and hopefully most lasting, story is not even posted from the game I started playing. I have just finished playing the game, and I know a couple of you already are. Good thing you did what I did! You made the game, and you made a game as good as Lord of Atlantis. So you make it worse! Good for you, good for the world, good for a game, you made it.

This game is better and I will be reviewing it all, so if you are just now using that word, skip to: Lady Sings the Blues - Lord of Atlantis
