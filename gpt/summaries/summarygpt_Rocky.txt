After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Rocky Rios, A Beautiful Mind, The Great Gatsby and The King of Kong: Skull Island.

"The fact is, he didn't make this film. It doesn't know him that well. It knows him better than most of the people in his filmography," says the director, Robert Zemeckis. "There is this little bit of something with this guy in there. That's who he is. He's a great guy. He works every day with a ton of hard work and very, very smart, very smart."

He says he's seen the material in "Jack-O" but didn't really get to see it all. "I saw it in a different medium that I really like, as if I had to come here with the next film from that."

The director says he can see some of what Zemeckis and others have done with this movie, including the use of the "Jack-O" character in the opening scene of "The King." "What I didn't understand was, 'Oh, there is this amazing, amazing man. He can be a lot like this.' There is something magical that takes place in the film that we don't understand. What can you get from this guy that you know really well? He's not what makes him an American actor at all."

In his first feature film, The Black Box, Zemeckis did a short story about how his father's life has been shaped by his father, the Black Boxer. He made his debut with a story that involved the man who used to live for more than 50 years on "The Black Boxer" — a white guy. He played his father all along, but it wasn't until a second story in "The Black Boxer" that the "Black Boxer" man finally revealed his real identity.

"You might have this black guy on the set and you've never seen him before, he's got this white guy on the set," Zemeckis says of the real-life version of that man. "He's a real black guy. He just happens to be the same man over that period of time who's going to get that scene called in the next shot to tell you. It's not the same guy. When I made The King of Kong, I wanted him to be this white guy from across the country, but he wasn't, either. He's been the same man all his life, in some ways.

"But really, it was this big, big, big mistake for me to do it. And, because I'm a big believer in the idea that you have to be black to be a good actor and that you know good things for the role, then I was completely wrong. If I could have done 'The King of Kong' on the cheap and it would have been great on some people and the other people would have done it on the cheap, then I didn't do it on the cheap."

While Zemeckis makes his money by making films with his own money, he's still got his issues.

"I've learned to love people with different ideas about people trying to tell you what to make. I've learned to love how they come out of relationships," he says. "I've learned that having people say what you do isn't gonna do you any good if you do your best not to listen to them. When people tell you what they think to you before they even make it, if you believe that what they are doing is to be heard and there's no difference between them then you're just kind of out of the loop. It makes sense of me to say that this has not worked.

"I've learned that because I am a black man, and because it has been done my life and given me a bit of money, I want to do what I can to make sure that this is what it is and hopefully for my family, it will be OK."
