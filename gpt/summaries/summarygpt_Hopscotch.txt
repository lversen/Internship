After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Hopscotch: a life-sized movie of the first half of 1968. It's about a young girl named Hopscotch (Tara Nungesser), an American actor named Billy Lynn (Bob Odenkirk), the one who lost his mother in Vietnam. We don't even learn much from Hopscotch... until we're given an impression of her childhood. We know she didn't go to the movies because she took an M.D. at the age of 12, so after she moved back to California and started filming in California, she's still able to talk and talk and talk. The first chapter I saw at the Sundance Film Festival was titled "You're Dead." There were so many things about '68 that I thought, we'll have to do it again or else you'll kill me now." There was this song called "I Got Away With Murder" in which she says she took a long time to build, and it's just hard to think now about. I guess you could say the only difference coming out of her second film, from the beginning, was just that a lot of people thought "How did she do it again?" You can't look back on those days. That's why I started a very broad group of people to give you these ideas about how a "Dance With Dragons" movie would work. I've had people give me ideas like that, because when I first started working for Warner Brothers, they were such big movie company, they were so big and so famous, they were such big movie stars. It's so hard to imagine what an "Raging Bull"-style movie would really be, because it involves so many things... the plot, the way you kill people, the way you're able to walk and talk and talk. And this new thing people were coming up with was that, because it was so very different in that way, it would be hard to imagine what the movie would really be about. Now I'm sure when it's just us or some kid on the road, and they're sitting in the back of the car, with the lights on, and people are talking and you're really getting high on something, they might just look at the sky and say, that's what happened in '68 that made these movie-like moments and those things made that movie possible. It's an amazing film, but it's kind of the whole point. The things that I want people to see are the things that make it this big, not the things that get you in trouble. That's the only thing I want people to see, not the things that make it that big. This movie didn't have one single villain. It had three. I don't even think about talking about it anymore because a lot of people see that as being just one thing; it had people talking about it. So I think everybody would be just like, "Hey, everybody, here's an idea you can get us started on. Let's shoot 'em in the head." Or "Hey, we could make it an "A-list" movie! The music is the new way of talking about it, like in the original movies. And then when you've got the music and the lyrics, and there's such strong language and so much depth in the character of Billy Lynn and this whole "Dance With Dragons" thing and this whole different process of just how we make people like everybody else laugh and make you like you love, and then we come back and say, "Don't think about how the music fits in with the songs!" Well this part is just one of those times I think. And I really enjoy when people think about it and they think about it all through the years as they see people do movies. And it's more interesting when we do a movie like "Dance With Dragons, Part 1" and you're like, "Oh, that one too." People take these movies and they love them so much that they start re-writing them. And we've made a number of movies where we're just rewriting them down and saying, 'We actually got these characters that we want to play back in this movie.'" So to see somebody re-write this little bit, you have to say, "What you love about it is the way it feels. It might not make the same movie as it thought it would make, but it makes for some new, fresh storytelling for sure."

What makes the story "Dance With Dragons" different is what makes it so different from the original movies and because so much of it's about being a young girl that gets killed by the government. It ends there, but the film is so much better. And it's so many times about the people and the problems and everything, and they're just so beautiful to experience and so much fun
