After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Helping Hand (2009): You learn a little bit more about how this story develops as the story progresses. You gain a lot of experience, from story-writing to dialogue. I was asked the following question earlier: I was in a relationship once and I had just found out that we were going to be dating. How would you explain that, when you thought about it today? If you told me that she was married on television during those early days, would someone say something like that to you? The answer would be no. I had done a good job of understanding that when it came to relationships, it wasn't quite how men were feeling and I felt like I needed more help in that process, but that was certainly true. The idea of "being married" was very new to me when I read the script for The Helping Hand for what that is. It was very exciting to tell my story and with great success I'm excited to put The Helping Hand back on. We have been working on The Helping Hand for a number of years now, and now this is our first movie. I can say that I'm extremely happy to say that The Helping Hand, which I co-wrote with my very own writer (H. D. McDonough), got a C on CinemaScore and a C- CinemaScore when it was released on April 8th, 2011. I'd like to thank all of the people who wrote and directed this movie, and all the people who gave feedback and love to it. It's a huge honour to have that part to play with, but I believe, given all your time and energy, it could well be the first film of the new franchise. The Helping Hand was the first film written by a writer-director in Hollywood as opposed to the usual method, which would have been writers with few credits and fewer collaborators in the writing process - they had to pick and choose what was interesting and what wasn't. That's all I'm going to say. Also, I'm so grateful for being given the opportunity to take part in an amazing movie and help put this movie up in the minds of a wide-range of people. Thanks to all who came forward and made this film, and all who donated and helped make it happen in the film world. Also to everyone who got involved on social media and made it happen by contacting us. And I really don't have to continue, because I will never get it right, but thanks to you and all of the people who helped me do what I did there. Hope you like It.
What's up, guys?
For the record, we're not even leaving! I wanted to let everyone know, I'm on the phone with my family, we're doing filming a scene with Tom Hanks at The Mummy's premiere in New York City on May 16th (9:00 PM, U.S. time).
