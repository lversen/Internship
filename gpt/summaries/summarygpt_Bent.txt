After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Bento's Revenge. It's actually a short film that's about a group of young women who were forced to come here and play as a group of men. One of them is forced to sign up for a military promotion as a service member. She's chosen to be one of the more than 20,000 women served in active duty overseas for the Army. A new recruit who has served well because she had a good job as an Army girl and was a good friend. Her brother joins her in his new position and they go to take her out to dinner where her brother was a soldier. Unfortunately she doesn't remember anything about this and her brother doesn't want her to be a part of the family, so they go back to the barracks and when Mom and Dad leave they all turn back to work. Everyone is now trying to move on, leaving everyone around the world with questions and problems they haven't found out about yet. The movie has several funny moments that were cut in order that this audience might get to see what's real but really had a lot more fun when only two of the characters involved got their answers. All of these issues have a lighthearted tone that helps bring the movie into the real world where the world gets much older and is much more challenging. If you're something who plays a "movie nerd" you'll definitely love this film.
