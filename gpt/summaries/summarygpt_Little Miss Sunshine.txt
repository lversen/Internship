After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Little Miss Sunshine

Drama (8.13): This is a short drama. A lot of people love the premise of the story, and as the story progresses, it is possible to give a synopsis. The whole project was pretty much based on the movie as it was set up, but I didn't want to take a character's life and make it worse.

Director (8.13): I couldn't help myself, because while I did love this film, I really didn't want to let it spoil it for other people. I don't know whether I'm even going to keep it up in the next decade, or just be honest (I also don't know if I want to keep it in the future). It really didn't go as planned. But that doesn't mean that there won't be a sequel.

The director (8.13): We are very much in this movie for a change (which is great for fans, as I think of this film almost as if we already know what we want in this movie (if only we knew about the sequel?). It just seemed too much. For me, I was worried that if I started getting impatient and decided to wait for more years, I might think that the plot is much better for this film. When I saw it last night, it was perfect. I liked it, and it got me a better perspective on the story. And what was this 'little masterpiece' like?

I think now that I have seen the actual film, I will say that the story really does not end. It just keeps progressing and I am a part of it for the rest of the years that I am here, I am part of this movie. And in this series we keep telling our own stories, so that doesn't feel an injustice or even as being biased. It is not the first time I have watched this movie. When this movie comes out this year, I will definitely be a part of this movie more than ever. I know that I am one of the first people that will get to watch the sequel. And it reminds me of my own past as a small kid. I would like to hear what you think about the movie, or any aspects I missed that will matter in this future.
