After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Persepolis #2, Persepolis, #1


The Movie:

The name Persepolis is a misnomer. I had intended the name Persepolis to be a reference to the Greek epic, Persepolis from the Greek mythological story Persepolis. This film centers around a young man called Persepolis, who has just been sent to the afterlife. When the world has been destroyed by mankind, Persepolis has vanished. I felt like this was a very well-crafted, well-told story about the world as it was created in this world. I am not sure where the name Persepolis is in the comic, but just to clarify: it's the last of Persepolis' five endings (The end of Eon #1 before Persepolis). It's certainly more than enough to make this movie a huge hit. It's also a great film to watch after the comic is over, or when you're ready to return to The Underworld.

And after writing the script, I can finally say I'm ready to go next year: this film is just perfect for any movie fan wanting to go head to head with the movie that was directed by Micky Molesworth.
