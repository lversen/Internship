After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Thank You for Smoking Gun. This movie features:

The story of a boy whose parents are forced to pay the price of a smoking gun and take refuge with the evil gun owner.

the story of a boy whose parents are forced to pay the price of a smoking gun and take refuge with the evil gun owner. The action in the movie is action packed.

I would argue that this movie is very challenging to watch. A lot of the action comes from the gun owner, this movie is very different. So many people have played the role of the policeman but what they are doing in this movie shows them how dangerous it is.

I'll take it that the gun and the gun owner and the parents who are involved are different. The fact that the movie takes place in a modern day, modern office and what are the details that you see here can come as a surprise to some if I am not mistaken.

At the end of the second act this scene ends and the young children take a break to make their way forward on board of a plane. The movie ends just right and it was not to be missed by everyone watching the movie.
