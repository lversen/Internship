After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) was the first to have a scene that had a major climax. All the major scenes had the same script and had a very important and subtle difference. The other key difference was in most scenes it was played straight. A scene like the last was often a very direct take on a scene for a scene the movie was in. It was so important for us to tell the big story, the way the story played out, that it would be perfect for that first scene that we had just written. And so we had to be that exact opposite every time we wanted something dramatic. For both the last and first lines, we had to put that big scene ahead and do that in many different ways.

I know this might go against the direction you're taking, but I digress. As far as storywriting and writing goes, all the actors in this movie are doing their job right. The actors in the films like Draco Malfoy are actually quite good and wonderful, and the actors in Harry Potter are actually quite bad. So when you look at what the actors are doing in the movies and in the big films, especially on the big screen, and the different characters, the acting of those characters and the scenes they play, it's quite obvious that there's a difference between how the actors in their work would react when their character was in the big and small versions of these things. You start to think of it as being something unique, it's simply a different way of working, and that's just right.

We have made a lot of choices between the big and the small version of these things, and that's why it's so exciting at this moment. The story at the end of the day, a lot of things don't feel right. In some ways I think it's good. The big thing in particular is the dialogue itself, with the action and the action in each scene, really making the characters feel really alive and moving. And that is the part we get to do today, in the movie. It feels great to see this film's story at the end of these parts. It's a wonderful thing to play as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

The other very special thing we're doing is our character dialogue. And you know that's where the character, Rubeus Hagrid, was just like in Harry Potter. He was a very, very powerful wizard. He had great power. When she stepped out of Hogwarts and into the castle, and when she got out of the castle and took on the role of Hagrid, she was one of the big stars of Hogwarts. And if I'm going to say that to you, I think you're going to be completely wrong: she had tremendous power. She could literally destroy anything in the world for whatever reason, and that's a very nice, very powerful skill. I think that's just incredibly cool.

JEROME: You've said earlier that you feel like the writing of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the final version of the story is much more involved in your personal life than the movie. Do you think there's much to be gained by playing the role of Hagrid?

HIGRETS: I think it's really interesting. The biggest story of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the whole is about a young boy named Malfoy, whose name actually came from his uncle Fred Weasley. I remember thinking he was a little bit more mysterious than you would expect from Malfoy, but when it came to the character and the story of one of the great characters of the Harry Potter series, I think the writing and the direction we took on it was quite good. And at the time of writing he was a very, very good character, a rather nice young man…

JEROME: What, exactly?

HIGRETS: Well, obviously a great character. I mean they put the entire idea and the plot together, but you could put any number of different people together, from one actor to the next or if you like, a lot of different guys. When you work with such a smart, talented cast, you have the freedom to decide which actor to do your character, and you do it with one or two people. But at the end of the day and I remember telling you, when you look at all the different actors that go on the show, or go on the set and play actors of any stripe, it's all different in their abilities and experience. That's what makes it great. At the end of the day, I'm really proud of it.

JEROME: What's the big difference with having a character who's in a relationship with you, for instance, what happens when they take on the role of Hagrid…
