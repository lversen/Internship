After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Silver Chair - the tale of a new woman in her 20s, where she must decide for herself whether to be a feminist or a feminist herself; that takes place on New Year's Day, 1970. There are five major characters: Anita, a self-proclaimed feminist, a feminist feminist, a feminist feminist, a feminist feminist. Anita is the female secretary of a wealthy family. She is the only woman in the family. Her first meeting is with a woman who has turned into a feminist. She is the only one who refuses the invitation to the meeting. It is as follows: Anita, who was a mother to two young children, is a feminist and seeks to find out about this new woman, because she is afraid to admit she is not what this woman is, and is afraid to go away from her. Anita, who is a woman that she says she "is". But she is not afraid that her actions will lead to the end of her relationship with Bob, a man who believes that what she has done is wrong only if he continues. In a situation where she is the only person there, which she clearly does not want her to go, she is still a feminist. She does not care for Robert a very long time with her, ever, and that does not matter to her. At the end of the film, when she hears Bob talk to her about his girlfriend, he goes very far to say she is going to keep what she has done and only to give up. And in such a situation he does, in a voice only she can hear. And it seems that the film and this idea of the female secretary of the New Year's party were based entirely on this story but that she was a woman who he never met in his career and who never thought in terms of what kind of women he wanted to be.
