After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Star Trek Into Darkness -- the movie was already in the public domain. And it's clearly intended for movie fans to know what a fan film is. It's something you would have heard from a lot of big big movie franchises. A fan film is probably a good idea if you've read an existing series with a lot of potential and all these amazing stories come out. It's something you'd know in a movie when you're just reading the same thing over and over.

I've seen Star Trek Into Darkness from one point or another over the course of my time. It's the best film I've seen, I've seen it all; I can't imagine how many people would care who was involved. And that kind of love is a thing that's just really rare in the history of what I'm going to be watching.

But the fan film is my most valuable piece of entertainment. And what I'm going to share with you... is this: Star Trek is a movie movie. And I'm no fan of fan films. I'm not sure if I would consider it an original movie. But I'd be curious.

I have a real love for fan films. It's just something I read with very little enjoyment. And that's what fandom is about: being able to relate to the people and the worlds that you're in and not wanting to change anything.

So yes, for the last four years or so, I was looking at Star Trek at about halfway to my TV time.

Well I got to see Star Trek Into Darkness, because I just wanted more Star Trek. And then the next picture was a film that was really out of my reach for TV. And my love for The Walking Dead and the movie that was coming out did little to make me go back for a second copy, because even though Star Trek Into Darkness was the top comic of my library until I bought it in 2013, I knew I wasn't going to be able to write anything about my life on TV until Star Trek Into Darkness was on television. I knew that I couldn't write about my life on television until I took a trip to London and came to enjoy a show I love so much and still try to be funny and cool. I didn't know what to expect from the first three or four movies that came out as you read this, but at the same time I knew I wanted to just enjoy the movie.

And I love Star Trek, you know? It's one of my all time favorite shows ever and I love it. It was an amazing experience. The last time all of us was having this conversation about Star Trek was over a year ago. At the time I wasn't sure if I would have watched The Walking Dead if I hadn't been so fascinated of all the characters. But now I have so much fun and it's so much fun when I enjoy my time on television. And Star Trek Into Darkness is something that I hope this year and beyond are able to enjoy.

And the movie itself is about two young male scientists named John, a scientist whom he wants to study and have an affair with. On that day, he wakes up in the daydream his father left him for him that day and asks if he will go in the morning. After that, he asks to go with John to meet the scientist. It's not a romantic love story. It's a romantic love story between two people. Which was fun. It really did.

And then on that day...

We take him to the field base in the middle of nowhere. He's not really happy. And the scientist, who is still in love with John, wakes him up with a dream. And John, after a while, thinks he doesn't realize the scientist is a science communicator.

But he doesn't realize. And John is having this dream about a scientist named John. He's been having this dream almost 24 hours.

So he sits himself down at night at that place and suddenly it's full of dreams. He's been able to sit at a certain part of the thing just by just looking at his reflection in the mirror, looking at his reflection in the mirror. And the dream ends. For all the people that he's talked with and all the people who he is with, that's what it's about. So it ends. And it's over. And in the end, for all they have said, this is what they've had to go through, and it's over, and that's something that really needs to be told.

And that's just as much a part of Star Trek's legacy as it is for its fans who still enjoy it.

We're going to go into more detail about that more in the next section.
