After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Barfly the Black Mage (2013) in which a single bad guy can take down a gang of evil monsters, and a whole slew of evil-doers start coming back to haunt the city. They also steal the treasure and sell it to everyone they meet. This does lead to a number of bad things happen. First, they all become more powerful by the day, and then they all decide to just kill everyone on sight and hide out until nightfall. Barfly is mostly a great villain, but eventually some bad guys get over the past, and Barfly starts to get stronger and will eventually be back to take down everything on sight. Now, I like it. It's really bad and fun, but just not as good as it can be.
