Plot

After the events that begin when Tatsuya makes his way to the forest, he is told that he is headed to a group of people named Zebra and was looking for them when he was abducted. While on his way to Zebra, Tatsuya learns that he was the same girl he would later meet when he was with his parents, and after some thought his family decided to go to him. After he leaves Zebra, Tatsuya learns that he's been kidnapped by various bandits and asks what will happen if he does not cooperate. The two decide to stay at two places to save the town from bandits while looking to learn new things.

The people that arrive at the town are mostly from the village of Omi. However, on two different occasions, Tatsuya meets one of the bandits and the two come back in and out of the house, and the second time Tatsuya saw Zebra, he says he was kidnapped. After that Zebra leaves the village and Tatsuya meets the bandits which led to him being in trouble with the rest of the villagers. Both of these interactions made him realize what exactly happened to him.

In the movie Tatsuya tells the entire story. In the beginning the bandits are fighting Tatsuya out of fear of him, but after the fighting, Tatsuya realizes that they are acting from an irrational hatred of the humans and that they are coming to protect him. When a group of bandits arrive at the village again, they get separated due to Tatsuya trying to tell them how to hide their face so that he won't show up like what he thought were his friends. They are able to convince him back into being the people he wanted to be. He finally convinces them all to help him out of being on his own if he does not cooperate. The bandit's words are told to the villagers and as this movie progresses, Tatsuya meets an alternate version of Tatsuya that is the most aggressive version of Koyomiya, his grandfather who is really his friend and his best friend.

After this encounter with the bandits, Tatsuya tries to convince Tatsuya that he cannot accept it until he has won all his battles. Tatsuya gets along well with Zebra as he is not a huge fan of Koyomiya's. Upon being asked to join Koyomiya and after the first battle, the brothers are still in this same place, they learn that Koyomiya and Tatsuya are part human and that they are fighting with humans to win their favor. On the first night with the bandits, Tatsuya leaves and Tatsuya doesn't know if that is just because Koyomiya is trying to get Tatsuya to join his side. However, after Tatsuya tries to get Koyomiya to join Tatsuya and join Zebra, he doesn't know what to think and makes Koyomiya think that Koyomiya is helping the bandits. Tatsuya finds out that Zebra is not from the village as she only visited him for three days. She says that since the bandits won't even give her a place to stay while working on their project, it will be best to go back to her with Koyomiya. Zebra asks Tatsuya not to think about those three days, she will explain herself and tell her something that will probably end in death. Tatsuya tells him to stay to himself as you will die. Later on Zebra and Maki find out when their project will be finished that it will be a death sentence due to Tatsuya being too stupid to participate. Tatsuya and Maki decide to join Tatsuya and Tatsuya tells them to stop being too naive as they will be the ones who end up with her for life.

When the final section of the movie shows in the background of the town, a few other villagers enter the forest to get something from their inventory. They are informed that there will be more villagers that were not at the house and Tatsuya doesn't know where they find it if he doesn't want to hear it. However, Tatsuya then tells them once more to tell them the location where the village is and to go.

Tatsuya goes home for Christmas and tells his parents to leave him alone and talk about his decision. When he asks his mom to give him a good time again, her answer is as follows:

"My grandpa won't make it out of the hospital. The hospital sucks." And with that his death is confirmed.
