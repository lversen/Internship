After this input give a synopsis of this movie: A Hora da Estrela movie set back in time to the time of the founding of Santa Monica, CA in 1812. A new, new and important country which offers to all its citizens its most ancient, traditional and most prosperous language: English. And also its greatest beauty and story: A Hora.

What was in the movie?

A Hora is a fictional Hora, which derives from its Latin words meaning "The River of Light." This language is written in Latin and its origins in the Spanish language may come from some other language or race. The original English language was called Hora.

What did it mean to you?

Hora was literally translated as "The Heart"; to create an ideal life. This was what people thought the word would mean in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was first recorded. We still hear a lot of the same language today, just more modern.

What were those ideals that made Santa Monica, CA, an ideal place to live?

Santa Monica was also founded on the principles of the Declaration of Independence; people were free to have the most for themselves and to make a name for themselves on a national identity and identity of their own. It was the foundation for our language and culture.

Did your parents make the film for you when they made it?

They did right on their big green leaf. They thought that because of its green qualities it would be perfect for their children who grew up in a low income urban area. They thought the movie, or part of it, would also be great for their children who were in their late teens to early teens.

What was your idea about the movie, actually?

I was really hoping that that, along with the story and characters and the history of Hora, would give your family an understanding of the life and work of the founder, the city of Santa Monica, and how it relates to the lives of a number of people from both the U.S. and Spain.

You're all from the same district in Santa Monica County! What was that thing that's going on here?

This is a new school, one of the very few that has been in operation for nearly 30 years. The new school is called "Ancima Hora." It uses English for everything, but also for all aspects of the culture and for all aspects of life such as language, science and agriculture. It's run with the intention of creating a community full of people of all beliefs and backgrounds to share their values of freedom, equality and peace of mind with one another. For those who have been in Santa Monica County and live there for decades, and who have their own different worldviews of what happiness is, it is an ideal place to live.

What's a good summer job like?

So you've had a good school season. How would you describe that time?

We started on March 11th with a good start because I feel like we don't have a lot of time to go over all the information. We don't have a lot of time to really spend with the kids. We don't usually go out at 2am, but one of the things we had to do was get up and get dressed and we did that. We had lots of other things that were different from our normal normal time, like the beach or whatever the special days were, it was cool to go to the pool or whatever it was like, and we would get out and play for hours.

So when do you need to call that?

Around 6pm

What part of the movie is new?

We're always going to try to get a little bit new. Sometimes the first one we're going to be on.

Is it going to be old school or less new?

We're a little different about the movie. It's trying to stay as fresh and fresh as possible in terms of what it means to us.

When do you release your film?

At 12:01 PM

That's right, for 12:01-1:01 p.m. at Universal Studios in Hollywood (where you'll be able to watch your films at 9pm.)

Are there any extras you would really like to see in Hora?

We'd love to see some. Also, we'd love to have a special event with some of these friends who made their way here over the years, or with some of you who worked for us, or who've supported us, we'd love to have it as a little gift in our very special place with all of them, we'll really miss them!

What would you like to see in your next Hora movie?

With no special event or
