The plot line of the film follows three different versions of John Connor: his father, who is a scientist who is helping the Lone Ranger in his quest to defeat the demon known as Doomsday – and his son, who is a police officer.

It's a story that sees Connor use his knowledge of nuclear weapons to help the Rangers – who are now battling a new warlord named Zodiac – to free himself of his powers after a crash landing off the coast of California. After Zodiac defeats the demon known as Doomsday he decides to turn back and begin restoring order by creating an entirely new generation of Rangers.

While his son is still in California, the elder Connor will learn more about the city of San Francisco and where his family went as they tried to stop the invasion of San Francisco.

Plot Notes:

The screenplay was written in English for a production I, Richard T. Balsam, worked for. The production design was by Jim Brabham, who worked in the British Cinematic Group. The screenplay is also based on Stephen Frears's novel, The Lone Ranger (which I had no idea had anything to do with the movie).

Filming Time:

The story has been set to take place in the season four premiere of The Walking Dead. During this time, "The Flash" would follow the journey of Bruce Wayne and his team as they fight to restore order and stop the zombie outbreak in New York City.

The filmmakers, Steven Spielberg and Stephen Frears, were originally hired as the production team for the film and in an upcoming interview, Steven was asked if he thought the film would be made based on his work, and he said, "Yes and no." Then he added, "I'm going to say that we do very well with 'The Flash' but we're not going to try and do it in the way we wanted to.

Steven didn't like the book because of his personal belief [about] whether or not we would be able to do a 'flashforward,' but we couldn't really do it without going into some more philosophical territory and asking ourselves…

"No, I think that the idea of a 'flashforward' for the 'Flash' would be really a mistake because most of their material has to do with the fact that they're writing this book, in ways that we have to talk about these flashbacks because they take place in those seasons, and the idea is that there is that one shot that's about to take place. But it also has to be set in chronological order, so we're doing this season three as a flashforward, because there's not really anything of significance to that. It goes back more in terms of the events where the events really took place over a shorter period; it's about what went on this year, and as well it must be set in chronological order, and so, you never know what's going to happen next year, that kind of thing. So, we tried to go where we would have made it and we just didn't get it."

The script was written as a follow-up to Stephen Frears' 2004, book The Walking Dead.
