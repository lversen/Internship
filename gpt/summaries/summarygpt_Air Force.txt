After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Air Force Special Ops: Deception. The only characters with real faces on the screen are Captain America (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain Boomerang (Zach Galifianakis), Hydra (Chris Hemsworth). It also takes place four years after the events in Air Force 1 where the US invaded New York to counter the threat from Russian invaders, and since all of the characters are wearing the same clothes and don't know where they're going (see the image above) they are forced to decide whether to join the military together or not. It's pretty much the same plot you get in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.

In other words, if you only have two male superheroes living together they've already seen that much.

On the other hand, some female characters didn't get the action they deserved.

I should note that, on this book about super heroines, the book's protagonists aren't being given the attention they deserve.

As for the female characters, their dialogue takes something off the rails and sometimes just gets lost in dialogue.

For example: Captain Marvel (Chris Hemsworth). Apparently, some of the female characters on this Earth have some kind of mental illness, and when Captain Marvel is forced to learn a super-powered weapon, she becomes the last woman on Earth – and that's when she is really starting to act as a heroine.

To sum it up, she's one of the most difficult characters a woman has ever seen or seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The truth is, if you ask me at least one female superhero is going to die, I'd say, this has to be the greatest story we've ever read of a woman's existence.

This is a movie where I think my favorite action is always going to be in the hands of my heroes on the screen.

It takes place four years after this movie:
