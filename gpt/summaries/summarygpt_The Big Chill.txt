After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Big Chill, The Wolfman and the Green Dragon

The three characters on the list have the most important role in a movie adaptation. I am in the director's chair and they say, well, you guys are telling the story of your movie. But what is that? What's that? The movie is a screenplay about characters, or movie, and this is not a movie about a guy who gets to become a detective. This is a guy whose journey has to happen in the world of a detective. He works for a detective agency, gets hired as something of a spy, then gets to work with spies. And then the spies get told to go undercover, and they do this, and he is able to get to work against some of them. He's a spy like all of us except one.

The film is an adaptation of William Styron's original play The Man Who Cried, which was an English-language adaptation of the French classic of The Night of the Living Dead, about a boy who, when his father falls for the monster monster, must prove that his father is wrong, that he can survive, and that his mother was wrong. The story of the book, of the boy who has to find the monster monster and try to find what it is, it's part of a great series of plays by John Cray, and it's such a story about humanity. Like most science fiction, that story was about survival, and those books, for their readers, were about survival, and survival is really about survival.

But we had so much fun reading them here, because we had been introduced to all these stories and everything about the world they're based on and how they relate to people. We knew about this science-fiction movie about survival. Then I saw The Wolfman, and I couldn't help but want to read all the movies with their characters. These stories have to be written here in the United States as a science fiction movie, and that way they can be told in the United States in the proper way. I couldn't stop from reading The Wolfman because in the U.S.A. the movies are not based on the things that scientists believe. What you hear in all the movies, in fact, is the stories are actually fiction rather than science. A lot of science fiction is based on fiction, and with The Wolfman it's sort of like the first time you hear a novel about a certain problem about humans.

Why are you writing all these movies?

Let me tell you, it's so easy, because we are so different. Some of the most fantastic stories I have been writing have started when I am 20 years old in Europe, and they still exist, so it's like a natural, natural process. I've had this huge problem in my mind about how I shouldn't be afraid to tell the movie world in a way that's all interesting. For a lot of my time, that was the world of science fiction, so of course it's not that I hate those stories. It's just that the movies are just so amazing, and we didn't know about the world of science fiction until we were about 10. As a kid, I didn't know how to go about that, and it was like I had no idea what I was actually doing in the world.

So we were never afraid to read them. Like this young man has two glasses, and he sees that all the time, except when he sees something crazy and suddenly is scared, so he uses his glasses to see what it is you could imagine. And at one point, he even does some research. All of that is very well done. His life is very, very real.

So was The Wolfman a science fiction movie?

Well, it was a novel, by the way. But all the same, that didn't matter because it was this story that was made. The story of the story of the monster monster was basically the same as all the other science fiction movies, and to a degree we liked it and even got the idea. We weren't as opposed to science fiction or any other kind of stories as we'd seen before, but we liked science fiction because it wasn't about the monsters or the events, and then it was supposed to be about the story of the monsters or the world.

So where was The Wolfman when it came to science fiction? Did you do that research before the book came out?

No, nothing. Because I never got an account of how I was supposed to read science fiction books before the book came out. I never thought I was going to read science fiction, even though I was in elementary school. I thought I was going to read science fiction because it was interesting. I thought science books were so interesting that they made sense
