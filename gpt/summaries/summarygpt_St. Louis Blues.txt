After this input give a synopsis of this movie: St. Louis Blues Blues vs. Detroit Red Wings

So for this movie go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCtX4K1nRK7

When I heard a movie called St. Louis Blues vs. Detroit Red Wings I immediately looked up the following information.

So there is more than 10 minutes of video and all of it of a Blues team vs. Red Wings movie. Only 3% of the movie was of the Red Wings. Why should that be considered a movie?

When he told me the trailer is still up and running and there are some changes there he said "yeah we did that before the movie was done there".

They do change what the name of the movie is and what it is based on and he said "oh well I can do that" which I do not agree with.

A bit below you also can find some very interesting videos as well, like to see the trailer before St. Louis Blues vs. Detroit Red Wings.

For these youtube links follow the instructions of the game and get the movie.

My link for the movie now is to the Youtube page http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ1F9NUdVUk

(this link isn't needed yet in this game since it's an older version)

As for the trailer I just watched it and that isn't it. It might be a little longer than this one. Still I was very much interested.

Please let me know if you have any video or video links for this game.

So in the end St. Louis Blues vs. Detroit Red Wings movie would be the greatest movie ever to be made and this year it would just be more and more like an event.

Do you have any other information?
