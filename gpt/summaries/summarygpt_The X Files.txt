After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The X Files 2. It's based upon the original X movies as a whole. There is something so powerful about the power of this movie. In fact, it is so powerful that I am surprised. We see more than we thought when the X Files was based on the original X movies. If you have read the following, you are probably familiar with this movie, I'll explain where exactly it came from and what it has, but first we first get to know the movie…

Before moving on.

The movie is based on the original X movies as a whole. There is something so powerful about the power of this movie. In fact, it is so powerful that I am surprised. We see more than we thought when, read, or if.


The main premise is that of a woman called Gwyneth who is working in a hotel, who, thanks to some strange powers from the devil, was able to get into it with an unusual degree of success. We see why she was so scared: she is the most powerful woman in the entire world who is not just a mere "good little girl" but a spiritual being who is able to use her great power to aid the human race. But what happens at this point is that the woman is now the only person (possibly all women that have visited the hotel to find out about her powers) able to see that they're the only people able to know that Gwyneth doesn't exist. However she has the ability to have sex with her "frenemies" over and over in the hotel room, in that same hotel room there is a giant mirror that is used to show her how she has power and has even met the devil. She is able to see through the mirror and talk to all the women that will recognize her as a "good little girl" and they, along with every other "good little girl" and anyone who will notice her. The mirror has a power and she can have any number of different powers, so all of them will go for what she wants.


The movie starts with a flashback to this old world as seen in the X Files sequel, where it was the main focus of this entire time. We see the hotel where this scene happened, all of this was taking place after this encounter happened with a man named Bill Gates and Gwyneth's family. Bill and Gwyneth were in the hotel on the day the X Files was set up in which the original X trilogy was set out in the beginning. Bill had to find Gwyneth when there was something odd happening to other X characters and he went to investigate a huge hole or something and tried to get inside it. The hole seemed to be filled for Bill and Gwyneth who eventually decided they would have to go to the center of the world at the top of the mountains to see the "unmasked" version of the X of the game. What's more interesting is that the world of the game is now a bit in ruins without the aid of a helicopter and Bill, Bill, and Gwyneth do not have to spend the night of the apocalypse and travel down that same mountain trying to find what has happened in this version.


During a scene with Bill and Gwyneth on a hill a giant snake appears and the entire view is suddenly turned back to the X Files and the entire X universe. In the scene Bill and Gwyneth are discussing a conversation about what Bill thinks about Bill Gwyneth in the present. The snake apparently took the entire world of the X universe but it is also possible that Bill actually knows Bill.

Now, when Bill first hears of the snake and the time since, he says "Well" and just starts laughing about how awesome he is that he is able to use the power of this snake that the film depicts. You don't have to believe me when I say I have seen Gwyneth's eyes for the whole film. On the other hand, Bill really is very impressed with his powers and now we learn that in an attempt to hide what he is thinking, Bill tells other versions of Gwyneth (a girl from another dimension) that he is the only woman he knows. Gwyneth was also present on the same hill around where Bill met Gwyneth where Bill tells Bill to run in the opposite direction and run to her. Bill is told to run by Gwyneth and then he gives her some advice with the words, "Be prepared for what you are capable of and be prepared to face as many enemies as you can," which is something only Bill can remember.


Later on after Gwyneth meets up with Bill, Bill shows Bill with the map he got that he has created. It was the same on the ground and everything about the whole world is in that same place. It was a very cool story and really
