After this input give a synopsis of this movie: The Song of Bernadette

If this movie is all I got to look forward to a year from now, and the next thing I know that "The Secret of Bernadette" will be seen is on TV in the 90's.

The second part of the movie is about the people and their struggles to work together in society.

The first part of that movie is about the relationship between people of different races.

And in that part I also got to look back at my dad's life in the 70's.

So that part is about how people become better citizens.

The movie is a very touching, nostalgic film.
