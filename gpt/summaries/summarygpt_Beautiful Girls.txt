After this input give a synopsis of this movie: Beautiful Girls, but the one who has the most flaws is that she has no friends and no family and that it isn't even close and all in all that one scene, where she is trying to do her best to do her best to avoid the worst and just do it while she's getting married. What should I say?

(So, the second scene, where she finally meets the kind of guy who gives her a date, in my opinion, made this movie the best. There seems so many little flaws in the original, and the first scene where she is going to have a bad dream. I just can't tell what the next scene was about – I did not want to watch this, I also did not want to watch this movie – so i hope you enjoy this movie. Enjoy!)
